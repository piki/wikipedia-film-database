It stars [[Carol Burnett]], [[Glenda Jackson]], [[James Garner]], [[Lauren Bacall]], and [[Paul Dooley]], and was written by Altman, Dooley and Frank Barhydt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Health&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/77555/Health/full-credits.html|title=Health|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film's title is an acronym for &quot;Happiness, Energy, and Longevity through Health&quot;.

A parody and satire of the U.S. political scene of the time, ''HealtH'' is set at a [[health food]] convention at a [[Florida]] luxury hotel, where a powerful political organization is deciding on a new president.  The election is rife with backroom deals and scandal; a businessman, Colonel Cody, is out to [[vote rigging|rig the votes]] and the outcome.  [[Dick Cavett]] and [[Dinah Shore]], two television [[talk show]] personalities of the time, are mentioned prominently in the film.

''HealtH'' was made by Robert Altman's company, Lion's Gate Films (no relation to [[Lionsgate Films]]), in early 1979.  It was the director's last film for the [[20th Century Fox|20th Century-Fox]] studio, which shelved its official release for over two years.&lt;ref name=maltin/&gt; Despite this, it received festival showings and a brief Los Angeles run during 1980. The film was broadcast on various U.S. television stations over the years, including [[The Movie Channel]] and [[Fox Movie Channel]], but has never been issued on home video.

==Plot==
Bearing similarities to Altman's 1975 film ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'',&lt;ref name=subliminal&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/robertaltmanssub0000self/page/|url-access=registration|quote=Robert Altman's HealtH.|last=Self|first=Robert T.|title=Robert Altman's Subliminal Reality|page=[https://archive.org/details/robertaltmanssub0000self/page/ xix]|isbn=0-8166-3790-3|year=2002|accessdate=2010-04-28|publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with a plotless structure,&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=interviews&gt;{{cite book|last=Sterritt|first=David|title=Robert Altman: Interviews|isbn=1-57806-187-3|year=2000|publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|128}} ''HealtH'' chronicles the progress of a health-food convention held at a luxury hotel in [[St Pete Beach]], Florida.  As the convention takes place, the members of an organization called HealtH hold a campaign to find out who will become its President.  (Their name stands for &quot;Happiness, Energy and Longevity through Health&quot;;&lt;ref name=maltin/&gt; it also serves as their slogan.&lt;ref name=plecki/&gt;{{rp|113}})  The candidates are Esther Brill, an 83-year-old afflicted with narcolepsy who calls herself &quot;the first lady of health&quot;; Isabella Garnell, who is serious against [[commercialism]] and [[materialism]]; and Dr. Harold (Gil) Gainey, a salesperson-turned-[[independent (politician)|independent]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=survivor/&gt;{{rp|82}}&lt;ref name=plecki&gt;{{cite book|last=Plecki|first=Gerard|title=Robert Altman|isbn=0-8057-9303-8|year=1985|location=Boston|publisher=Twayne Publishers (G.K. Hall &amp; Company/[[ITT Corporation|ITT]])|url=https://archive.org/details/robertaltman0000plec}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|113}}

On the first day of the conference, [[The Steinettes]] (a female [[Quartet#Popular music|quartet]] dressed in green and yellow) introduce Dick Cavett, who is hosting [[The Dick Cavett Show|his show]] on location and covering the details of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gcciAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IO4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5069,1837656&amp;dq=dick+cavett+robert+altman&amp;hl=en |last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|title=Altman's new film: It's very healthy|date=1979-05-19|accessdate=2010-05-01|work=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He interviews Gloria Burbank and Esther Brill, two of the candidates competing for the new Presidency of the HealtH organization.  Burbank, a [[White House]] representative, has been sent to this venue on the [[President of the United States]]' behalf.  Later that day at the hotel lounge, Burbank's ex-husband&lt;ref name=plecki/&gt;{{rp|113}} Harry Wolff plans to re-schedule the Cavett interview, due to difficulties with Brill during her profile.  The moment Burbank heads to her room, Gil Gainey (a minor candidate) stops her and debates on the worth of her strategy.

On the morning of the second day, several conventioneers notice a seemingly dead body sunk to the bottom of the pool from their balconies. Harry Wolff and the President's advisor on health, Gloria Burbank, are chatting by the deep end of the pool. Gloria then dives into the pool, not realizing there is a body floating on the bottom. As she approaches it, she finally sees it and screams in fear, heading back to the surface.  Some other men dive in to rescue the drowned body, but it turns out that Gainey had been using an [[oxygen tank]] in order to play a [[publicity stunt]].&lt;ref name=plecki/&gt;{{rp|113}}

That night, Garnell announces a serious message from the top of the hotel through her loudspeaker; many guests take notice, and some complain.  Around that time, a businessperson named Colonel Cody arrives at the conference, and heads to Garnell's room to interrogate and find out her plans.

Next morning, Harry finds out that Burbank is beginning to support Garnell, and thinks that this is not right.  Later on, while discussing [[breastfeeding]] and [[abortion]] with Brill, Burbank is astonished that Garnell and Brill were actually born male.  After serving in the [[United States Army|Army]], both had [[sex reassignment surgery|sex change operations]] in 1960.  Bobby Hammer, a dirty tricks specialist, actually concocted this revelation to trick Burbank.&lt;ref name=survivor/&gt;{{rp|82}}

After another discussion with Brill, Burbank enters the empty convention hall, where Cody interrupts her.  He finds her title, and the ideals of the HealtH organization, worthless.  Ashamed and in tears, Burbank is shocked that he controls not only HealtH, but also the ongoing election; he even plans to [[vote rigging|rig the votes]] and the outcome.  She runs back to tell Wolff on Cody's scheme.  As the couple start making love, Burbank is worried that it will be all over for her if Garnell wins.  Harry, however, assures her that Garnell is still a woman anyway.

On the fourth and final day, the results of the HealtH election are announced live on Cavett's show, and Esther Brill comes out as the victor.  Burbank and her ex-husband watch on from their balcony outside, and also take a glimpse at Cody proposing an offer to Brill.  Some time later, Cody, who turns out to be her harmless nut brother, gets into a fit of anger, knocking down everything in his path, and demands to get away immediately.

With the HealtH convention over, another one involving [[hypnosis|hypnotists]] is taking root at the hotel.&lt;ref name=loneliness&gt;{{cite book|last=Kolker|first=Robert Phillip|title=A Cinema of Loneliness: Penn, Stone, Kubrick, Scorsese, Spielberg, Altman|isbn=0-19-512350-6|year=2000|edition=3rd|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|url=https://archive.org/details/cinemaofloneline00kolk}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|385}}  Before he and the candidates leave, Cavett briefly greets Dinah Shore,&lt;ref name=cliff&gt;{{cite book|last=McGilligan|first=Patrick|title=Robert Altman: Jumping Off the Cliff|url=https://archive.org/details/robertaltman00patr|url-access=registration|isbn=0-312-30467-6|year=1989|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|476}} the host on hand for this event.&lt;ref name=loneliness/&gt;{{rp|385}}  As the HealtH sign is taken down in front of the hotel, the Steinettes perform a Broadway-style [[show tune]] that closes the film.

==Production==
[[File:Don Cesar.jpg|thumb|Robert Altman shot ''HealtH'' at the [[Don CeSar]] hotel, [[St Petersburg Beach]], Florida.|alt=A pink, multi-floor hotel stands out above a calm sea and a windswept beach.]]
Under the supervision of [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]], head of 20th Century-Fox,&lt;ref name=interviews/&gt;{{rp|128}} director Robert Altman made ''HealtH'' for US$6 million&lt;ref name=houdini/&gt;{{rp|84}} through his Lion's Gate Films company (unrelated to [[Lionsgate|the present-day firm based in Vancouver]]).&lt;ref name=interviews/&gt;{{rp|xxviii}}  At the time, Altman had commitments to deliver films for Fox until 1981;&lt;ref name=plecki/&gt;{{rp|113}} ''HealtH'' was his fifteenth feature project.&lt;ref name=regarding&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=u3MjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lGcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4611,3400308&amp;dq=health+robert-altman&amp;hl=en|last=Huisking|first=Charles|title=Regarding Robert Altman's 'Health'|date=1979-02-23|accessdate=2010-05-01|work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]|page=1-C}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;[Alan] had great faith in me,&quot; he told [[David Sterritt]] in 2000; &quot;he put his own job on the line.&quot;&lt;ref name=interviews/&gt;{{rp|128}}  Of the film's timing, he said, &quot;''HealtH'' could have only been made when it was made, and that was the end of the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] era.&quot;&lt;ref name=subliminal/&gt;  This and 1979's ''[[Quintet (film)|Quintet]]'' were Altman's first collaborations with writer Frank Barhydt;&lt;ref name=cliff/&gt;{{rp|608, 612}} the two would later work on the 1988 HBO miniseries ''[[Tanner '88]]'',&lt;ref name=interviews/&gt;{{rp|xxxiii}} as well as 1993's ''[[Short Cuts]]''&lt;ref name=interviews/&gt;{{rp|xxx}} and 1996's ''[[Kansas City (1996 film)|Kansas City]]''.&lt;ref name=interviews/&gt;{{rp|xxxi}}

In response to the diminishing box office returns of his last three efforts (''[[A Wedding]]'', ''Quintet'' and ''[[A Perfect Couple]]''), and in case any delays could put a damper on his financing, Altman rushed ''HealtH'' into production.&lt;ref name=survivor/&gt;{{rp|81}}&lt;ref name=cliff/&gt;{{rp|475}}  The film was shot in sequence&lt;ref name=plecki/&gt;{{rp|113}} at only one location:&lt;ref name=anemic&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19810213&amp;id=FPALAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=K1oDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5421,3563464|last=Ross|first=Robert Alan|title=Altman's anemic 'HEALTH' shown on cable television|date=1981-02-13|accessdate=2010-05-01|work=St. Petersburg Times|page=3D}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Don CeSar|Don CeSar Beach Hotel]] in St Pete Beach, Florida.&lt;ref name=plecki/&gt;{{rp|113}}  Production began on February 20, 1979,&lt;ref name=regarding/&gt; and continued for three months.&lt;ref name=plecki/&gt;{{rp|113}}&lt;ref name=state&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/650156742.html?dids=650156742:650156742&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Apr+29%2C+1979&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=ALTMAN+IN+A+STATE+OF+'HEALTH'&amp;pqatl=google |last=McLeod|first=Michael J.|title=Altman in a State of 'HealtH'|date=1979-04-29|accessdate=2010-04-30|url-access=registration |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=N1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The crew chose the Don CeSar, said Altman, because &quot;we felt [this] would be fun, with lots of crazy situations and off-beat characters.&quot;&lt;ref name=regarding/&gt;  [[Joseph Byrd]] worked on the music score,&lt;ref name=cliff/&gt;{{rp|612}}  along with supervisor [[Allan F.

To capture the authenticity of the convention in the movie, art director Bob Quinn and co-writer Frank Barhydt visited an actual one in [[Boston]], Massachusetts before shooting.&lt;ref name=regarding/&gt;  Over one hundred health food companies contributed to the set.&lt;ref name=regarding/&gt;  One of them, Sovex Granola, participated during the shoot; their scenes did not make it into the finished film, but they received end-credit billing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMMk4pl4LB4C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=Robert+Altman's+HealtH&amp;hl=en|last=Richmond|first=Akasha|title=Hollywood Dish: More Than 150 Delicious, Healthy Recipes from Hollywood's Chef to the Stars|isbn=1-58333-241-3|page=23|year=2006|accessdate=2010-05-01|publisher=[[Penguin Group|Avery]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After canceling plans for a March debut in January 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/622913032.html?dids=622913032:622913032&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jan+23%2C+1980&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=Tempo&amp;pqatl=google|last=Beck|first=Marilyn|title=What they're doing to 'Health' probably makes Altman sick|date=1980-01-23|accessdate=2010-04-30|url-access=registration |work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|page=B7}}&lt;/ref&gt; they moved it to their summer schedule;&lt;ref name=voices/&gt;{{rp|17}} Altman's strategy was to have the film released in time for [[1980 United States presidential election|that year's presidential campaign]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=subliminal/&gt;&lt;ref name=voices/&gt;{{rp|19}}

Before that could take place, the company's new president, Norman B. Levy, planned an April 1980 run in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref name=houdini/&gt;  Altman went against it&lt;ref name=houdini/&gt; and suggested test runs in four markets instead: [[San Francisco]] and [[Sacramento]], California; [[Houston]], Texas; and Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=houdini/&gt;  The resulting previews played to poor audience response,&lt;ref name=houdini/&gt; and some time later, Fox deemed it uncommercial for release.&lt;ref name=survivor/&gt;{{rp|82}}  In the end, the company replaced it on their schedule with ''[[Oh! Heavenly Dog]]'', a crime comedy starring [[Chevy Chase]] and [[Benji]] the dog.&lt;ref name=voices/&gt;{{rp|19}}

Save for [[Sherry Lansing]], who loved the film, Robert Altman had a fallout with Fox personnel over their handling of ''HealtH''.&lt;ref name=houdini/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes2&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/18/movies/film-view-robert-altman-an-endangered-species.html|last=Canby|first=Vincent|authorlink=Vincent Canby|title=Film View; Robert Altman—An Endangered Species|date=1982-04-18|accessdate=2010-04-30|work=New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|page=D17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After filming ''Popeye'', Altman tried to contact Norman Levy on its status.  The filmmaker complained, &quot;[Levy] didn't return my phone calls for seven weeks. That's just basic rudeness. I don't think he knows what a movie is anyway.&quot;&lt;ref name=houdini/&gt;  Moreover, he said of the studio's distribution unit: &quot;Norman Levy and the rest are scum. [...] They're not interested in movies. They're interested in [[ski lift]]s and [[Coca-Cola]].&quot;&lt;ref name=houdini/&gt;

Amid this situation, Altman began to distribute ''HealtH'' on his own&lt;ref name=loneliness/&gt;{{rp|329–330}} by taking it to the [[film festival]] circuit.&lt;ref name=plecki/&gt;{{rp|115}}  The comedy was screened at the [[Montreal Film Festival]] in August 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gMocAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vloEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2055,4493069&amp;dq=health+robert-altman&amp;hl=en|title=&lt;u&gt;FILM FESTIVALS...&lt;/u&gt;some good, some bad, some special|date=1980-08-29|accessdate=2010-04-30|work=The Sherbrooke Forum|page=Forge 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later appeared at [[Telluride Film Festival|Telluride]]&lt;ref name=houdini/&gt;{{rp|84}} and [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]].&lt;ref name=plecki/&gt;{{rp|115}}  Of the response at those venues, the director said: &quot;It has a love-hate reaction—but what's wrong with that?&quot;&lt;ref name=houdini/&gt;{{rp|84}}

By September 1980, the festival exposure prompted 20th Century-Fox to hold over a month&lt;ref name=houdini/&gt; of preview screenings at the [[Regal Entertainment Group#United Artists Theaters|UA Theater]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/658225292.html?dids=658225292:658225292&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Sep+14%2C+1980&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Other+125+--+No+Title&amp;pqatl=google|title=CALENDAR|date=1980-09-14|accessdate=2010-04-30|url-access=registration |work=Los Angeles Times|page=T37}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood, Los Angeles]];&lt;ref name=houdini/&gt;&lt;ref name=plecki/&gt;{{rp|115}} a nationwide release was also considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PbsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hVoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5781,281560&amp;dq=health+robert-altman&amp;hl=en|last=Beck|first=Marilyn|title=Film clips (Beck on Hollywood personalities)|date=1980-09-01|accessdate=2010-04-30|work=St. Petersburg Times|page=3D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aYwuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8ocFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2753,8835297&amp;dq=health+robert-altman&amp;hl=en|author=[[Associated Press]] (AP)|title=Robert Altman's latest film is in ill health|date=1980-09-30|accessdate=2010-04-30|work=[[Tri-City Herald]]|page=Ent. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite even worse acclaim this time,&lt;ref name=houdini/&gt; Altman remarked that this run &quot;did respectable business, considering that there was no advertising.

On March 7, 1981, a [[16&amp;nbsp;mm film|16&amp;nbsp;mm]] print of ''HealtH'' was shown at the facilities of [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=&quot;siskel&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/630984472.html?dids=630984472:630984472&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Mar+15%2C+1981&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=MOVIES&amp;pqatl=google|last=Siskel|first=Gene|authorlink=Gene Siskel|title=Poor 'Health' gets strange but robust local premiere|date=1981-03-15|accessdate=2010-04-30|url-access=registration |work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|page=D12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film also received a screening in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, on March 28.&lt;ref name=voices/&gt;{{rp|17}}  On April 7, 1982, it received its official cinema opening&lt;ref name=filmthreat/&gt; at the [[Film Forum|Film Forum 1]] in New York City.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

==Reception==
On the day of the film's Los Angeles opening on September 12, 1980, a review from [[Charles Champlin]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described the film as &quot;essentially a revue sketch, giving the boys and girls of the chorus a chance to dress up funny and mill about. All a revue sketch needs is a thin premise, a point of view and an exit line. But having only one out of three won't make it for a movie.&quot; He concluded, &quot;If indeed Altman weren't so original and so talented, an indulgent mess like ''HealtH'' would merely be another unsuccessful film in a bad year. It is instead mournful and exasperating in about equal measure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Champlin|Champlin, Charles]] (September 12, 1980). &quot;Altman's 'Health' Arrives&quot;. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Part VI, p. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the Film Forum premiere, ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[Vincent Canby]] wrote: &quot;''HealtH'' is, I suppose, a mess, but it is a glorious one in the recognizable manner of a major film maker who sometimes gets carried away—by his subject, by his own enthusiasms and those of his actors, and by the collaborative creative process he loves. As do so many of his films, ''HealtH'' gives one the feeling of being on a nonstop party with the people who made it.&quot;  He added that it &quot;is no masterpiece, but it is one of the most appealing entertainments that Mr. Altman has ever put together&quot;.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;  In a later article, he declared: &quot;''HealtH'' deserves to be seen by anyone interested in the career of this most eccentric and unpredictable of contemporary American film directors.&quot;&lt;ref name=nytimes2/&gt;  

[[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' called it &quot;a pretty bad movie&quot; and &quot;anemic. Altman sets himself up as superior to his insipid characters, laughs at them, and invites us to do likewise. That's not much of an achievement.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;siskel&quot; /&gt; [[Leonard Maltin]] gave ''HealtH'' two stars out of four in his ''Movie Guide'', and added: &quot;Non-Altman fans may love this more than devotees; Woodard steals the film—no easy feat considering that incredible cast—as [the] hotel's ultra-patient manager.&quot;&lt;ref name=maltin/&gt;  ''Halliwell's Film Guide'' referred to it as a &quot;zany satirical all-star romp on the lines of ''A Wedding'' but by no means as likeable or laughable, considering its cast, as it should be&quot;.&lt;ref name=halliwell&gt;{{cite book|editor=Gritten, David|title=[[Halliwell's Film Guide]] 2008|chapter=Health (*)|page=519|isbn=0-00-726080-6|year=2007|location=[[Hammersmith]], London|publisher=[[HarperCollins]] Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Film Bulletin'' called it a &quot;misfired satire&quot;, and commented that its &quot;major stars [...] are otherwise wasted&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iasqAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Altman+-+HealtH+-+satire&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=39|title=HealtH|volume=49|year=1980|accessdate=2010-05-10|work=Film Bulletin|publisher=Wax Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1985 book on Altman, Gerard Plecki called ''HealtH'' &quot;a humorous companion piece to ''Nashville''&quot;, adding that it &quot;was certainly a major improvement over his two previous films&quot;.&lt;ref name=plecki/&gt;{{rp|113}} In regards to the studio shelving the film, Plecki remarked that it &quot;certainly deserved mass marketing and a large promotion campaign&quot;.&lt;ref name=survivor/&gt;{{rp|115}}

On June 12, 1982, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] screened the film at [[Camp David]] during stormy weather. In [[The Reagan Diaries|his diaries]] that day, he called it &quot;the world's worst movie&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reagan|first=Ronald|authorlink=Ronald Reagan|title=[[The Reagan Diaries]]|editor=Douglas Brinkley|chapter=June 12, 1982|page=88|isbn=0-00-726305-8|year=2007|accessdate=|location=New York|publisher=HarperCollins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Since its release, ''HealtH'' has been viewed as a parody, and satire, of the U.S. political scene at the time of its filming;&lt;ref name=maltin/&gt;&lt;ref name=subliminal/&gt; critic Daniel O'Brien also noticed &quot;the parallels between the [HealtH] election and the U.S. Presidency explicitly spelt out (several times)&quot; in the film.&lt;ref name=survivor/&gt;{{rp|82}}  In his book ''A Cinema of Loneliness'', Robert Phillip Kolker stressed this aspect, writing that &quot;Altman creates a world that is a parody of a political phenomenon that is itself already a parody of show business, for political conventions always mediate the realities of power with the signifiers of spectacle. ''[HealtH]'' is, finally, a representation of a representation.&quot;&lt;ref name=loneliness/&gt;{{rp|384}}

Kolker also observed Altman's use of the [[carnivalesque]], a style from Russian critic [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] that the filmmaker employed in many of his productions.&lt;ref name=loneliness/&gt;{{rp|382}}  O'Brien called this the film's &quot;strongest asset [...], complete with [[huckster]]s and suckers (a handy [[metaphor]] for most aspects of American society&quot;.&lt;ref name=survivor/&gt;{{rp|84}}

In Kolker's words, ''HealtH'' is &quot;a hilarious documentation of politics and culture at the end of the Carter era when passivity began to disguise itself as self-satisfaction and marginal interests requested majority attention&quot;.&lt;ref name=loneliness/&gt;{{rp|382}}  The convention in the film &quot;becomes a small mirror of larger political follies, of silly, self-serving people so convinced of their importance that they take for granted the fact that major significance attends their ridiculous activities&quot;.&lt;ref name=loneliness/&gt;{{rp|382}}

O'Brien noted that in ''HealtH'', &quot;most of the main characters exhibit the expected Altman eccentricites&quot;, including the candidates in the election.  &quot;All this comes across as a little forced,&quot; he continued, &quot;recalling the random weirdness of ''[[Brewster McCloud]]'' rather than the carefully etched [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncrasies]] of ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' or ''[[3 Women|Three Women]]''.&quot;&lt;ref name=survivor/&gt;{{rp|84}}  Moreover, someone says &quot;Hit it!&quot; just before the convention band replaces the opening Fox fanfare.&lt;ref name=loneliness/&gt;{{rp|384}}
