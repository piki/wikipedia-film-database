==Plot==
Meenatchi Sundara Sasthiriyaar ([[Sathyaraj]]) is a successful, cunning Brahmin lawyer in the city, and has never lost any case. He is known for his sheer intelligence in the court, and he is very brutal in nature, having excessive feelings for his caste. He is married to Parvathi ([[Raadhika|Radhika]]), whom he always calls as Bombai. Also, they have a beautiful daughter named Janaki ([[Nagma]]).

Edison (also played by Sathyaraj), a man who comes from the area of Ambetkar, is a road roller driver and localite who trains fighting for his localites, living with his poor and affectionate people at the slum. He is a staunch atheist and is like the leader of his group. He has trouble with the minister of that area whose name is Amsavalli ([[Vichithra]]). When his area is affected by a storm, he, along with his group, goes to the minister for help, but the minister badly abuses and insults their group. He and his friend Mani ([[Goundamani]]) both get into a verbal exchange with the minister, leave the place and rebuild their huts. Angered by this, the minister orders her henchmen to beat up Edison and set the huts on fire, and the huts get burnt. As Edison reaches his anger point, he rides a bulldozer and demolishes the minister's house. Also mysteriously, she is killed, but the blame falls on Edison for driving the bulldozer on her and killing her.

In the meanwhile, previously Edison has saved both Parvathi and her daughter Janaki. Due to this, Janaki falls in love with Edison and Parvathi has a good regard for him. Upon seeing Edison's current situation, Parvathi asks her husband to be the lawyer for Edison and save him from the death sentence. Meenatchi Sundara Sasthiriyaar agrees to this. What happens next forms the rest of the story and the rest of the movie.
