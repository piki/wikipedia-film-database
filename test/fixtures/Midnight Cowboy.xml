'''''Midnight Cowboy''''' is a 1969 American [[Buddy film|buddy]] [[drama (film and television)|drama film]]. Based on the 1965 [[Midnight Cowboy (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[James Leo Herlihy]], the film was written by [[Waldo Salt]], directed by [[John Schlesinger]], and stars [[Jon Voight]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]], with notable smaller roles being filled by [[Sylvia Miles]], [[John McGiver]], [[Brenda Vaccaro]], [[Bob Balaban]], [[Jennifer Salt]], and [[Barnard Hughes]]. Set in [[New York City]], ''Midnight Cowboy'' depicts the unlikely friendship between two hustlers: naive [[Male prostitution|prostitute]] Joe Buck (Voight), and ailing [[Confidence trickster|con man]] &quot;Ratso&quot; Rizzo (Hoffman).

The film won three [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. ''Midnight Cowboy'' is the only [[X rating|X-rated]] film ever to win Best Picture (though such a classification no longer exists), and was the first gay-related Best Picture winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://online.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/pdf/10.3828/jlcds.2014.1|title=Gay Pasts and Disability Future(s) Tense|first=David|last=Mitchell|journal=Journal of Literary &amp; Cultural Disability Studies|volume=8|issue=1|pages=1–16|access-date=May 21, 2017|doi=10.3828/jlcds.2014.1|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of prostitution and sex work&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Midnight Cowboy | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Prostitution and Sex Work | publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |location=Westport | last=Ditmore |first=Melissa Hope | year=2006 | volume=1 | pages=307–308 | isbn=9780313329685}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been placed 36th on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|list of the 100 greatest American films of all time]], and 43rd on its 2007 updated version.

In 1994, ''Midnight Cowboy'' was deemed &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot; by the [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing|publisher=[[The Library of Congress]]|work=[[National Film Registry]]|access-date=January 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Joe Buck, a young Texan working as a dishwasher, quits his job and heads to New York City to become a [[Male prostitution|prostitute]]. Initially unsuccessful, he manages to bed a middle-aged New York woman in her posh apartment, but the encounter ends badly: he gives &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; money after she throws a tantrum when he requests payment, not realizing she is a [[call girl]].

Joe meets Enrico Salvatore &quot;Ratso&quot; Rizzo, a [[Confidence trick|con man]] with a limp who takes $20 from him by ostensibly introducing him to a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]]. After discovering that the man is actually an unhinged [[Religious fanaticism|religious fanatic]], Joe flees in pursuit of Ratso but cannot find him. Joe spends his days wandering the city and sitting in his hotel room. Soon broke, he is locked out of his hotel room and his belongings are impounded.

Joe tries to make money by receiving [[oral sex]] from a young man in a movie theater, but learns after-the-fact that the young man has no money. Joe threatens him and asks for his watch, but eventually lets him go unharmed. The next day, Joe spots Ratso and angrily shakes him down. Ratso offers to share the apartment in a condemned building where he is [[squatting]]. Joe reluctantly accepts his offer, and they begin a &quot;business relationship&quot; as hustlers. As they develop a bond, Ratso's health grows steadily worse.

In a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], Joe's grandmother raises him after his mother abandons him. He also has a tragic relationship with Annie, a mentally unstable girl. Ratso tells Joe his father was an illiterate Italian immigrant [[shoeshiner]] whose job led to a bad back and lung damage from long-term exposure to [[shoe polish]]. Ratso learned shoeshining from his father but considers it demeaning and generally refuses to do it (although he does shine Joe's cowboy boots to help him attract clients). Ratso harbors hopes of moving to Miami, shown in daydreams in which he and Joe frolic carefree on a beach and are surrounded by dozens of adoring women.

An eccentric man and woman approach Joe in a diner and give him a flyer inviting him to a [[The Factory|Warhol-esque]] party; Joe and Ratso attend, but Ratso's poor health and hygiene attract unwanted attention from several guests. Joe mistakes a [[Joint (cannabis)|joint]] for a cigarette and starts to hallucinate after taking several long puffs. He leaves the party with Shirley, a [[socialite]] who agrees to pay him $20 for spending the night, but Joe cannot perform sexually. They play ''[[Scribbage]]'' together and the resulting [[Word play|wordplay]] leads Shirley to suggest that Joe may be gay; suddenly he is able to perform. The next morning, she sets up her friend as Joe's next client and it appears that his career is starting to thrive.

When Joe returns home, Ratso is bedridden and feverish. He refuses medical help and begs Joe to put him on a bus to Florida. Desperate, Joe picks up a man in an amusement arcade and robs him during a violent encounter in the man's hotel room. Joe buys bus tickets with the money so he and Ratso can board a bus to Florida. During the trip, Ratso's health deteriorates further: he becomes [[Urinary incontinence|incontinent]] and sweat-drenched. 

At a rest stop, Joe buys new clothing for Ratso and himself and discards his cowboy outfit. On the bus, Joe muses that there must be easier ways to earn a living than hustling, and tells Ratso he plans to get a regular job in Florida. When Ratso fails to respond, Joe realizes he is dead. The driver tells Joe there is nothing to do but continue to Miami and asks Joe to close Ratso's eyelids. Joe, with tears welling in his eyes, sits with his arm around his dead friend.

==Production==
The opening scenes were filmed in [[Big Spring, Texas]]. A roadside [[billboard]], stating &quot;IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN OIL WELL...GET ONE!&quot; was shown as the New York-bound bus carrying Joe Buck rolled through Texas.&lt;ref name=&quot;boredncgdoches&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exquisitelyboredinnacogdoches.blogspot.com/2006/10/midnight-cowboy-1969-locations.html|work=Exquisitely Bored in Nacogdoches|author=Chris|title=''Midnight Cowboy'' locations|date=October 5, 2006|access-date=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such advertisements, common in the Southwestern United States in the late-1960s and through the 1970s, promoted [[Eddie Chiles]]'s [[Western Company of North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/if_you_dont_have_an_oil_well_get_one_eddie_chiles_of_western_company/|title=The Big Apple: &quot;If you don’t have an oil well, get one!&quot; (Eddie Chiles of Western Company)|first=Barry |last=Popik|work=The Big Apple|date=August 22, 2007|access-date=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Joe stays at the [[Hotel Claridge]], at the southeast corner of [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and West 44th Street in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. His room overlooked the northern half of [[Times Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onthesetofnewyork.com/midnightcowboy.html|title=Midnight Cowboy Film Locations|work=On the Set of New York|access-date=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building, designed by [[D.

Despite his portrayal of Joe Buck, a character hopelessly out of his element in New York, Jon Voight is a native New Yorker, hailing from [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/qsonhist/celebrities/voightjon.html|title=Jon Voight|work=Slovak Studies Program|first=Martin|last=Votruba|publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh]]|access-date=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dustin Hoffman, who played a grizzled veteran of New York's streets, is from [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monitor: August 10, 2012 |first=Grady |last=Smith |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |page=27 |date=August 10, 2012 |accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/dustin_lee_hoffman_born_1937_1929184|title=The Birth of Dustin Hoffman|work=California Birth Records, 1905 Thru 1995|access-date=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voight was paid &quot;scale&quot;, or the [[Screen Actors Guild]] minimum wage, for his portrayal of Joe Buck, a concession he willingly made to obtain the part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Associated Press]] |title=Voight Worked for Scale for 'Midnight Cowboy' Role |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2013/08/29/arts/ap-us-people-jon-voight.html |work=[[The Denver Post]] |date=August 29, 2013 |access-date=August 29, 2013 |publisher=Digital First Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line &quot;I'm walkin' here!&quot;, which reached No. 27 on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]], is often said to have been improvised, but producer [[Jerome Hellman]] disputes this account on the 2-disc DVD set of ''Midnight Cowboy''. Although the scene, which originally had Ratso pretend to be hit by a taxi to feign an injury, is written into the first draft of the original script,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/Midnight%20Cowboy.txt |title=Midnight Cowboy by Waldo Salt; Based on a novel by James Leo Herlihy; Draft: 2/2/68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffman's version explained it differently on an installment of [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]]'s ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]''. He stated that there were many takes to hit the traffic light just right so that they wouldn't have to pause while walking. In that take, the timing was perfect, but a cab came out of nowhere and nearly hit them. Hoffman wanted to say, &quot;We're filming a movie here!&quot;, but decided not to ruin the take.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xfinity.comcast.net/slideshow/entertainment-unscriptedmoviemoments/8/ |title=Greatest Unscripted Movie Moments |access-date=September 20, 2012 |last=Onda |first=David |publisher=[[Xfinity]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817130034/http://xfinity.comcast.net:80/slideshow/entertainment-unscriptedmoviemoments/7/ |archivedate=August 17, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon initial review by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], ''Midnight Cowboy'' received a &quot;Restricted&quot; (&quot;R&quot;) rating. However, after consulting with a psychologist, executives at [[United Artists]] were told to accept an &quot;X&quot; rating, due to the &quot;homosexual frame of reference&quot; and its &quot;possible influence upon youngsters&quot;. The film was released with an X.&lt;ref name=&quot;tino&quot;/&gt; The MPAA later broadened the requirements for the &quot;R&quot; rating to allow more content and raised the age restriction from sixteen to seventeen. The film was later rated &quot;R&quot; for a reissue in 1971. The film retains its R rating.&lt;ref name=&quot;tino&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monaco |first=Paul |year=2001 |title=History of the American Cinema: 1960–1969 |series=The Sixties |volume=8 |location=New York |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |isbn=9780520238046 |page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film earned $11 million in rentals at the [[North America]]n box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Big Rental Films of 1969|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 7, 1970 |page=15|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]] |url=https://ameblo.jp/ayumi-niwano/entry-12249691199.html |accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical response to the film has been largely positive; [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' said of the film: &quot;I cannot recall a more marvelous pair of acting performances in any one film.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-10-15/entertainment/9910200025_1_movie-reviews-star-film|title=The Movie Reviews|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|first=Gene|last=Siskel|date=October 15, 1999|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 25th anniversary retrospective in 1994, [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote: &quot;Midnight Cowboy's peep-show vision of Manhattan [[Low-life|lowlife]] may no longer be shocking, but what is shocking, in 1994, is to see a major studio film linger this lovingly on characters who have nothing to offer the audience but their own lost souls.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/1994/03/04/midnight-cowboy/|title=Midnight Cowboy|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|first=Owen|last=Gleiberman|date=March 4, 1994|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Midnight Cowboy'' currently holds a 90% approval rating on online review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with an average rating of 8.2/10, based on 62 reviews. The website's critical consensus states: &quot;John Schlesinger's gritty, unrelentingly bleak look at the seedy underbelly of urban American life is undeniably disturbing, but Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight's performances make it difficult to turn away.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/midnight_cowboy|title=Midnight Cowboy (1969) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was one of President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s favorites, with him reportedly screening it several times in the [[White House]] movie theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/presidents-favorite-movies-2016-8#jimmy-carter-many-from-all-the-presidents-men-to-midnight-cowboy-8|title=Here are 13 American President's Favorite Movies of All Time|last=Gottlieb|first=Meryl|date=September 10, 2016|work=[[Business Insider]]|access-date=April 9, 2018|publisher=Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
[[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]], who supervised the music and composed the score, won a [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition|Grammy for Best Instrumental Theme]].&lt;ref name=IMDb.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Midnight Cowboy (1969)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064665/|publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Neil]]'s song &quot;[[Everybody's Talkin']]&quot; won a [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Male]] for [[Harry Nilsson]]. Schlesinger chose the song as its theme, and the song underscores the first act. Other songs considered for the theme included Nilsson's own &quot;[[I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City]]&quot; and [[Randy Newman]]'s &quot;Cowboy&quot;. [[Bob Dylan]] wrote &quot;[[Lay Lady Lay]]&quot; to serve as the theme song, but did not finish it in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heylin |first= Clinton |year=1991 |title=Dylan: Behind The Shades: The Biography |publisher= Viking Books |page=193 |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-6708-36024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie's main theme, &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;, featured harmonica by [[Toots Thielemans]], but on its album version it was played by [[Tommy Reilly (harmonica player)|Tommy Reilly]]. The [[soundtrack album]] was released by [[United Artists Records]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mfiles.co.uk/reviews/john-barry-midnight-cowboy.htm |title= Midnight Cowboy — John Barry |publisher= Music Files |access-date=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title music from ''Midnight Cowboy'' and some of the incidental queues were included in the documentary ''[[ToryBoy The Movie]]'' in 2011.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Theme song===
* John Barry's version, used on the soundtrack, charted at #116 in 1969.
* [[Johnny Mathis]]'s rendition, the only one containing lyrics, reached #20 on the U.S. Adult Contemporary chart in the fall of 1969.
* [[Ferrante &amp; Teicher]]'s version, by far the most successful, reached #10 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and #2 Adult Contemporary in the winter of 1970.
