'''''The Cannonball Run''''' is a 1981 American [[comedy film]] starring [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Roger Moore]], [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Farrah Fawcett]], and an all-star supporting cast. Filmed in [[Panavision]], it was directed by [[Hal Needham]], produced by [[Hong Kong]]'s [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] films, and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film is based on the 1979 running of an [[Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash|actual cross-country outlaw road race]] beginning in Connecticut and ending in California.

It was one of 1981's most successful films at the box office. It was followed by ''[[Cannonball Run II]]'' (1984), and ''[[Speed Zone]]'' (1989). This and the 1984 sequel were the final film appearances of actor [[Dean Martin]]. It also featured [[Jackie Chan]] in his second Hollywood role. This plot is also used in the video game ''[[Need for Speed: The Run]]'' (2012) where Jack Rourke competes in the race for a $25,000,000 prize.

==Plot==
Race teams have gathered in [[Connecticut]] to start a cross-country car race.  One at a time, teams drive up to the starters' stand, punch a time card to indicate their time of departure, then take off.

Among the teams:
:*JJ McClure (Reynolds) and Victor Prinzi (DeLuise), drive a souped-up, but otherwise authentic, [[Dodge B-series van|Dodge Tradesman]] [[ambulance]]. (Hal Needham and Brock Yates used the same vehicle in the actual 1979 race.)
:*Former open-wheel icon (and Scotch-swilling) Jamie Blake ([[Dean Martin]]) and his (gambling-obsessed) teammate Morris Fenderbaum ([[Sammy Davis Jr.]]), dressed as Catholic priests, drive a red [[Ferrari 308 GTB|Ferrari 308 GTS]] 1979. (They are based on an entry in the real 1972 race, in which three men disguised as priests (&quot;The Flying Fathers&quot;) drove a [[Mercedes-Benz W108#New generation|Mercedes 280 SEL sedan]], which they claimed to be &quot;the Monsignor's car&quot; belonging to an [[ecumenical]] council of [[prelate]]s in California.)
:*Jill Rivers ([[Tara Buckman]]) and Marcie Thatcher ([[Adrienne Barbeau]]), two attractive women who use their looks to their advantage, start the race in a black [[Lamborghini Countach]].
:*[[Jackie Chan]] and [[Michael Hui]] race in a high-tech, computer-laden [[Subaru Leone#2nd generation|Subaru GL 4WD]] hatchback with a rocket booster engine.
:*A pair of good ol' boys, played by [[Terry Bradshaw]] and [[Mel Tillis]], drive a street-legal replica of [[Donnie Allison]]'s [[Hawaiian Tropic]]-sponsored [[NASCAR]] [[Winston Cup Series]] [[Chevrolet]] [[stock car]] owned by [[Hoss Ellington]]. (It starts off as '75–76 [[Chevrolet Laguna|Laguna]]. After they paint it, it somehow becomes a '76–77 [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo]].)
:*[[Roger Moore]] plays &quot;heir to the Goldfarb Girdles fortune&quot;, Seymour Goldfarb, Jr., who perpetually identifies himself as actor Roger Moore and signs into the race under that name. His character behaves similarly to [[James Bond]] and only once (by his mother) is called by his real name. He drives a silver [[Aston Martin DB5]]. (This film was released around the same time as Moore's next bona fide James Bond film, ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]''.)
:*[[Jamie Farr]] portrays an oil-rich Middle-Eastern [[sheikh]], driving a white [[Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow]].

At the starting line, observing from the shadows, is Mr. Arthur J. Foyt (a play on the name of racer [[A. J. Foyt]]), a representative of the &quot;Safety Enforcement Unit&quot;, who tries to stop the race because of its environmental effects and safety issues. In the car with Foyt ([[George Furth]]) is a photographer and tree lover, Pamela Glover (Fawcett).

Beyond the starting line, JJ and Victor (driving their ambulance) come across Foyt and Glover, who have been involved in a minor [[Car accident|fender-bender]]. Glover implores JJ and Victor to help, but when they tell Foyt to enter the ambulance through the back door, they [[kidnap]] Glover and take off without Foyt.

As the race progresses, Victor occasionally turns into his alter ego, superhero &quot;[[Captain Chaos]]&quot;. The very spooky Dr. Van Helsing ([[Jack Elam]]) and his huge hypodermic needle are also in the ambulance to &quot;help&quot; keep Glover quiet during the race.

Various teams are shown either evading law enforcement, most of which deal with talking their way out of a possible ticket, or concocting crazy schemes to outmaneuver their opponents.
:*Jill and Marcie use [[sex appeal]] as their weapon, unzipping their race suits to display copious amounts of cleavage during traffic stops. (However, this fails to work on a busty female traffic officer played in a cameo appearance by actress [[Valerie Perrine]].)
:*In New Jersey, the ambulance is pulled over by state troopers; Dr. Van Helsing drugs Glover, and JJ and Victor are able to convince the troopers that they're rushing &quot;the Senator's wife&quot; to UCLA for medical treatment (offering the theory, which to JJ and Victor's happy surprise is Van Helsing's idea, that her condition prevents them from flying, or from even driving through Denver).
:*The Subaru team is able to turn off their car's headlights and use infrared sensors for racing at night.
:*Seymour Goldfarb is frequently shown evading police by using various [[James Bond]]-type gadgets, such as oil slicks, smoke screens, switchable license plates, all installed in his [[Aston Martin DB5]].
:*Mr. Compton ([[Bert Convy]]) and &quot;Super Chief&quot; Finch ([[Warren Berlinger]]) disguise themselves as a newlywed couple on a motorcycle, but Finch's extra weight forces the two to ride cross-country in a continuous [[wheelie]].

The primary rivalry is between the ambulance and the Ferrari. In Ohio, Fenderbaum and Blake are able to convince Victor to pull over the ambulance in order to bless the patient on board. While Blake carries out the blessing, Fenderbaum flattens one of the ambulance's rear tires.  JJ gets his revenge in Missouri by convincing a nearby police officer that the two men dressed as priests are actually Communists and sex perverts who are responsible for the [[Indecent exposure|flashing]] victim in the ambulance.

The leading teams find themselves stopped on a desert highway, waiting for construction workers to clear the road. A biker gang (led by [[Peter Fonda]]) shows up and begins harassing Compton and Finch. It quickly gets out of hand and a free-for-all fistfight ensues. &quot;Captain Chaos&quot; re-emerges to fight the bikers. The Subaru team also joins in (Naturally, Jackie Chan puts his martial arts skills to work) and fists and kicks fly. The construction crew announces that the road is open, so the teams sprint back to their cars to resume the race.

The ambulance falls behind the pack until Victor once again becomes Captain Chaos. The vehicles all arrive at the final destination at the same time, so it is a foot race to the finish line. JJ hands his team's time card to Victor, then ambushes the remaining racers, leaving only Victor and one of the Lamborghini women, Marcie.

Just when it appears Victor will reach the time clock first, a spectator shouts that her &quot;baby&quot; has fallen into the water. Victor, still in his Captain Chaos persona, rushes to save the baby (later revealed to be her dog), allowing Marcie to clock in first and win the race.

JJ is furious and never wants to see Captain Chaos again, but Victor replies that he does not care, becoming the persona he really wants to be, Captain USA. JJ laughs and hugs him. Foyt reappears and blames everyone for ruining the American highway. Seymour offers a cigar and tells Foyt to use the lighter in his car, which activates an [[ejection seat]] when pushed. Nothing happens at first, but when Seymour presses the button, he (Seymour) goes flying into the water.

==Cast==
''Cannonball Run'' featured an all-star [[ensemble cast]], including these actors:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Film and Television In-Jokes|author=Bill van Heerden|page=318|year=1998|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|isbn=978-0-7864-3894-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Burt Reynolds]] and [[Dom DeLuise]] as racer J.J. McClure and his buddy, mechanic Victor Prinzi, a.k.a. &quot;[[Captain Chaos]].&quot;
* [[Roger Moore]] as Seymour Goldfarb, Jr., a self-parody of his role as [[James Bond]]. His car, an [[Aston Martin DB5]], displays the UK registration plate 6633 PP, same as the one in the Bond films ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' and ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]].'', although Moore's Bond never actually drove an Aston Martin in any of his seven Bond appearances.  (The original UK registration plate was BMT 216A before being sold to businessman Gavin Keyzar.) [[Molly Picon]] portrays his mother. Several women ride with Seymour, including model [[Lois Hamilton]], billed as Lois Areno.
* [[Farrah Fawcett]] as tree-loving photographer Pamela Glover. J.J. calls her &quot;Beauty.&quot;
* [[Dean Martin]] and [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] as race car driver Jamie Blake and scam artist Morris Fenderbaum, disguised as Catholic priests.  [[Jimmy Snyder (sports commentator)|Jimmy &quot;The Greek&quot; Snyder]] plays himself as Fenderbaum bets on his success. (Snyder was Dean Martin's neighbor when both were growing up in [[Steubenville, Ohio]].) Blake's car, a [[Ferrari 308 GTS]] 1979, is the same as the model in the TV series TV ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]''.
* [[George Furth]] as Arthur J. Foyt, the insipid, uptight main antagonist of the film, who tries to have the race stopped.
* [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Michael Hui]] as drivers of a [[Subaru GL]] filled with gadgets. In the opening part of the film, Chan and Hui are introduced on a talk show (hosted by [[Johnny Yune]]) as the operators of [[Japan]]'s entry into the race. (Both Chan and Hui were actually Chinese; furthermore, the credits mistakenly credit the two as &quot;[[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]] Driver(s).&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moviegazetteonline.com/blu-rays/blu-ray-review-the-cannonball-run/ &quot;Blu-ray Review: The Cannonball Run.&quot; moviegazetteonline.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jamie Farr]] as Sheik Abdul ben Falafel, a wealthy [[Arab]]ian potentate determined to win the race, even if he has to buy it. [[Bianca Jagger]] makes a brief appearance as his sister. Farr's car is a [[Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow]]. The Sheik is the only character to appear in all three ''Cannonball Run'' films.
* [[Mel Tillis]] and [[Terry Bradshaw]] are Mel and Terry, a couple of &quot;[[wikt:good old boy|good ol' boys|]]&quot; driving a thinly-disguised [[Chevrolet Malibu]] [[NASCAR]] Grand National race car, resembling the Hoss Ellington No. 1 Hawaiian Tropic car [[Donnie Allison]] drove in 1979, most famously in the [[1979 Daytona 500]] crash that led to the famous fight.
* [[Adrienne Barbeau]] and [[Tara Buckman]] as Marcie Thatcher and Jill Rivers, satin-[[Spandex]]-clad &quot;hotties&quot; in a black [[Lamborghini Countach]]. The same Lamborghini was used in the film's opening credits as it was being pursued by a [[Nevada Highway Patrol]] car. [[Valerie Perrine]] has an uncredited cameo as a state trooper. (Their character names are not mentioned during the story, but appear in the end credits. Their names return in the sequel, though the parts were re-cast.)
* [[Peter Fonda]] has a [[Cameo appearance|cameo role]] referencing his character in ''[[The Wild Angels]].'' The appearance of Fonda and his motorcycle gang during a halt in the race offered an excuse for Chan to demonstrate his martial arts skills during the fight sequence. Fonda's big, bald biker buddy is played by [[Robert Tessier]].
* [[Bert Convy]] as wealthy but bored executive Bradford Compton, who planned to run the Cannonball by motorcycle with the help of an old friend, Shakey Finch ([[Warren Berlinger]]), once the world's greatest cross-country motorcyclist. The two planned to disguise themselves as newlyweds. Compton's  now portly ally forced them into a [[wheelie]] for the entire race.
* [[Jack Elam]] as Doctor Nikolas Van Helsing, same name as the [[Abraham Van Helsing|famous vampire hunter]]. This Van Helsing is a proctologist and graduate of the [[University of Yangon|University of Rangoon]], and the Knoxville, Tennessee College of [[Faith healing|Faith Healing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Girardot|first=Frank|title=Frank Girardot: Jackson's 'doctor' embodies wrong prescription|url=http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_18998780|accessdate=27 March 2012|newspaper=Pasadena Star News|date=2011-09-28|quote=&quot;I'm Dr. Nicholas Van Helsing, doctor of proctology and other related tendencies.

* [[Rick Aviles]] and Alfie Wise as Mad Dog and Batman, tow truck drivers who jump the train flatcar.
* [[John Fiedler]] as the desk clerk.
* [[Joe Klecko]] as the [[Polish people|Polish]] driver in the van who gets pulled over by Mr. Foyt. (Klecko was a player in the [[National Football League]].)
* [[Car and Driver|''Car and Driver'' Magazine]] columnist and correspondent [[Brock Yates]], who having created the real-life Cannonball Run, wrote the film directly for the screen, plays the race organizer of who lays down the rules at the starting line.
* Director [[Hal Needham]] appears uncredited as the ambulance EMT.
* Veteran Daytona 500 commentator [[Ken Squier]] appears as a California Highway Patrolman.
* Veteran voice actor [[June Foray]] provided the dubbed dialogue of several of the women who escort Goldfarb in the race (&quot;Seymour's girls,&quot; as the opening credits list them) in an uncredited performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Magic Behind the Voices: A Who's Who of Cartoon Voice Actors|author=Tim Lawson &amp; Alisa Persons|pages=157–158|year=2004|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=1-57806-695-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The film continued director [[Hal Needham]]'s tradition of showing bloopers during the closing credits (a practice he started with ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]''). [[Jackie Chan]] says this inspired him to do the same at the end of most of his films.

===Original Race===
The film is based on the 1979 running of the [[Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash]], an actual cross-country outlaw road race held four times in the 1970s, starting at the Red Ball Garage on 31st Street in [[New York City]] (later the Lock, Stock and Barrel Restaurant in Darien, [[Connecticut]]) and ending at the Portofino Inn in [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]], California, in Los Angeles. 

The screenwriter was automotive journalist [[Brock Yates]], who had conceived the real-life Cannonball Baker event. Yates had originally proposed the race as a writer for ''[[Car and Driver]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webspace.webring.com/people/wb/belialprod/brockyates.htm|title=Brock Yates|accessdate=2011-05-14|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921032725/http://webspace.webring.com/people/wb/belialprod/brockyates.htm|archivedate=2012-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The race had only one rule: &quot;All competitors will drive any vehicle of their choosing, over any route, at any speed they judge practical, between the starting point and destination. The competitor finishing with the lowest elapsed time is the winner.&quot;

Yates' team was the only participant in the original 1971 running, which was named after the driver Ernest &quot;Cannonball&quot; Baker, who drove across country in 1927 and made it in 60 hours. Yates wrote a book about it called &quot;The Sunday Driver&quot;. In 1973 it was reported [[John G. Avildsen]] and writer Eugene Price was to make a film based on the book called ''The Cannonball-Baker-Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash''.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Goes to Lilliput
Weiler, A H. New York Times]21 Jan 1973: A13. &lt;/ref&gt; The film was not made but the race did inspire the (unrelated) 1976 films ''[[Cannonball (film)|Cannonball]]'' and ''[[The Gumball Rally]]''.

====1979 Race====
In the March 1979 race Yates formed one of 46 teams with director Hal Needham to compete with a 150-MPH van converted into an ambulance, with LA doctor Lyell Royer, and Brock's second wife, Pamela Reynolds, riding as the patient on the gurney. Although the ambulance never made it to the finish line &amp;mdash; the transmission gave out 50 miles short of the Redondo Beach finish line &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/170087/brock-yates-full-mph-column|title=Brock Yates' Full mph Column|accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; Yates made it to the movie as a race official and Needham as an EMT, as did the ambulance itself and even the transmission failure. The ambulance was stopped once, in Pennsylvania; that event made it into the movie, as did a cop stopping traffic in Kansas, exiting from a rodeo, to let the ambulance pass unimpeded.&lt;ref&gt;''Hollywood Stuntman Hal Needham Plays Not My Job'', National Public Radio's 'Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me', April 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Right Bra team was put together by rail-thin auto writer Judy Stropus, race driver [[Donna Mae Mims]] and Peggy Niemcek, whose husband was part of another entry, driving a Cadillac limo. In the movie, it became a two-woman team led by buxom [[Adrienne Barbeau]] driving a Lamborghini, but as auto writer Stropus said decades later, &quot;a little editorial license never hurt anyone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideline.com/features/the-cannonball-run-turns-35.html|title=35 Years Ago, the Original Cannonball Run Took The Green Flag|accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yates points out in his book ''Cannonball!''&lt;ref&gt;Cannonball! by Brock Yates, MotorBooks International, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; that Stropus's version of the race does not mention the baptism with green fluid from the porta-potty the three girls experienced when the limo overturned.

===Script===
The characters J.J. and Victor participate in the Cannonball Run in an [[ambulance]]: a heavily modified [[Dodge Tradesman]] van. In the beginning, J.J. says to himself &quot;we could get a black [[Pontiac Trans Am|Trans Am]]&quot;, then answers his own question with &quot;Nah that's been done,&quot; a reference to the ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' films of Burt Reynolds and director Hal Needham.

In an attempt to appear legitimate to law enforcement, the team of J.J. and Victor hires Doctor Nikolas Van Helsing, a frightening, yet friendly, [[physician]] of questionable skill played by [[Jack Elam]]. They kidnap attractive young photographer Pamela Glover ([[Farrah Fawcett]]) &amp;mdash; whom they nickname &quot;Beauty&quot; &amp;mdash; to be their cover patient. Beauty vehemently opposes her beastly captors at first, but eventually comes to [[Stockholm syndrome|sympathize with her captors]] and fall for J.J.

===Development===
Yates and Needham worked on a script and Al Ruddy became attached as producer. They wanted Reynolds to star, but he was reluctant to make more car-themed films. He was eventually persuaded by Needham's promise to keep the actor's schedule to only 14 days of filming, and a fee of $5 million plus a percentage of the profits. Finance came from Raymond Chow of Golden Harvest, who requested that Jackie Chan be included in the cast.

&quot;I did that film for all the wrong reasons,&quot; said Reynolds later. &quot;I never liked it. I did it to help out a friend of mine, Hal Needham. And I also felt it was immoral to turn down that kind of money. I suppose I sold out so I couldn't really object to what people wrote about me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Burt Reynolds: --Getting Behind the Camera Burt Reynolds Behind The Lens

Vincent Canby of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film &quot;inoffensive and sometimes funny.

==Accident==
On June 25, 1980 24-year-old [[German American]] stuntwoman Heidi von Beltz (1955–2015),&lt;ref&gt;Heidi was the daughter of Brad von Beltz (1928–1999), a veteran actor in Westerns.&lt;/ref&gt; a former championship skier and aspiring actor, was critically injured in a [[car crash]] during production of the film. The original stunt person had left the production to attend an emergency family illness, and the stunt coordinator [[Bobby Bass]] called his then-fiancee von Beltz to the set for a stunt that he said was to be &quot;a piece of cake&quot;. The car was to be driven by Jimmy Nickerson, weaving between oncoming vehicles while von Beltz rode in the passenger seat operating a smoke machine to give the impression the car was on fire. She was a world-class skier with no previous stunt driving experience. The Aston Martin car was beset with mechanical problems, including defective steering, clutch, and speedometer; it had bald tires, and no seat belts. Nickerson wanted repairs to the car but was told parts had not arrived and to &quot;make do.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/10/heidi-von-beltz-dead-stuntwoman-paralyzed-cannonball-run-crash-1201597841/|title=Heidi von Beltz Dies: Stuntwoman Paralyzed In ‘Cannonball Run’ Crash Was 59|accessdate=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/suffering-continues-paralyzed-ex-stuntwoman-24670|title=Suffering continues for paralyzed ex-stuntwoman|accessdate=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exponent.com/cannonball_run/|title=Cannonball Run Accident|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the car collided head-on with a van and Von Beltz's neck was broken leaving her quadriplegic.

When it became clear that von Beltz's personal injury lawsuit would exceed all available primary insurance coverage, the production's excess insurer, Interstate Fire (a subsidiary of Hollywood's favorite insurer, [[Fireman's Fund Insurance Company]]) sued von Beltz and her employer, Stuntman Inc., for a declaratory judgment that von Beltz's lawsuit was not covered under its policy.  In 1988, the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] ruled that there ''was'' a duty to defend, and that there was also a duty to indemnify to the extent that von Beltz was seeking recovery for mental injuries (the exclusion for bodily injuries was ruled to be enforceable).&lt;ref&gt;''Interstate Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Stuntman Inc.'', 861 F.2d 203 (9th Cir. 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

She was eventually awarded $7 million although a judge reduced the amount and she ended up with $3.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/1996/04/12/heidi-von-beltz-soul-survivor/|title=Heidi von Beltz: Soul Survivor|accessdate=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the settlement went to her attorneys and to paying off medical bills. The industry adopted mandatory seat belts on all stunt-car work primarily due to this incident.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/suffering-continues-paralyzed-ex-stuntwoman-24670&lt;/ref&gt;
