'''''Kalavaadiya Pozhuthugal''''' ({{lang-en|Stolen Moments|italic=yes}}) is a 2017 Indian Tamil-language [[romance film|romantic]] [[drama]] film written and directed by [[Thangar Bachan]]. It stars [[Prabhu Deva]] and [[Bhumika Chawla]] in the lead roles, while [[Prakash Raj]], Inbanila and [[Ganja Karuppu]] play supporting roles. [[Sathyaraj]] played a guest role as Periyar [[E. V. Ramasami]], reprising his role from ''[[Periyar (2007 film)|Periyar]]'' (2007). After beginning production in 2009, the film produced by [[Ayngaran International]] experienced delays due to the studio's financial problems, before being released on 29 December 2017.

==Cast==

==Production==
[[Thangar Bachan]] took time to convince [[Prabhu Deva]] to play the lead role, with the actor turning back on his initial decision to reject the film, and subsequently the venture began [[principal photography]] on 25 March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/jun-09-01/prabhu-deva-06-06-09.html&lt;/ref&gt; During the making of the film, it was believed that the film may be shot in the US, but the team chose to stay in India, with the shoot finished by late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/apr-09-01/prabhu-deva-01-04-09.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bhumika Chawla]] worked on the film after a brief sabbatical from Tamil films, and shot for ''Kalavaadiya Pozhthugal'' alongside her commitments for [[Sabapathy Dekshinamurthy|Sabapathy]]'s ''Maa'' with [[Prithviraj Sukumaran|Prithviraj]] and [[Srikanth (Tamil actor)|Srikanth]], which was later shelved.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.indiaglitz.com/bhoomika-is-here-to-stay-tamil-news-48721&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the producers' financial troubles meant that the film's release was delayed for 7 years. Likewise Ayngaran's other films shot in the late 2000s like the [[Jai (actor)|Jai]]-starrer ''[[Arjunan Kadhali]]'' and the [[Jeevan (Tamil actor)|Jeevan]]-starrer ''Krishnaleelai'' remain unreleased, while projects such as the [[A. R. Rahman]] musical, [[Kadhir]]'s ''Manavar Dhinam'' with [[Vinay Rai|Vinay]], were shelved after being launched.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiaglitz.com/vinay-in-maanavar-dhinam-tamil-news-41961.html&lt;/ref&gt; The team briefly geared up to release the film during 2013 by holding a promotional event, but it was further delayed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sify.com/movies/kalavaadiya-pozhuthugal-imagegallery-1-kollywood-nigkoJecibcsi.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movies/kalavadiya-pozhudhugal/kalavadiya-pozhudhugal-movie.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Thinkal Menon of [[The Times of India|Times of India]] wrote &quot;Thangar Bachan’s strength has always been strong characters and pure narration. This film, too, has its artistes emoting in the best possible way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Kalavaadiya Pozhuthugal Movie Review {2.5/5}: Critic Review of Kalavaadiya Pozhuthugal by Times of India|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movie-reviews/kalavaadiya-pozhuthugal/movie-review/62281176.cms|access-date=2020-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A critic from Indiaglitz.com wrote &quot;if you have zen like patience, you might get out with a palatable love story&quot; adding &quot;the film has plenty of nostalgia to offer as you slowly nod and acknowledge to yourself&quot;, but &quot;he pace of the film would do no good to the patience of the present day audience, especially when they have paid to watch a movie that is anachronistic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.indiaglitz.com/kalavaadiya-pozhuthugal-tamil-movie-review-17832&lt;/ref&gt; The New Indian Express wrote the film was a &quot;tedious time travel to the nineties&quot;, adding &quot;the flashback framing device that Thankar uses to drive home the intensity of the lead pair’s romance is plain archaic&quot; and &quot;even the supposed twists, for want of nifty staging, end up testing our patience&quot;. The critic added &quot;to make things worse, Thankar keeps shifting between being a filmmaker and pamphleteer&quot; and &quot;if you are someone who catches a shut eye in the theatres, you could, in fact, wake up to a different film&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/review/2017/dec/30/-kalavaadiya-pozhudhugal-review-a-tedious-time-travel-to-the-nineties-1739980.html&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, News18.com's Gautaman Bhaskaran wrote the film &quot;endears because of its fascinating story&quot; but &quot;unfortunately having been in the cans for about 10 years or reportedly so, the film may seem somewhat dated&quot; ,but &quot;then this is only a minor hiccup in a narrative styled with subtlety and a sense of purpose&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news18.com/news/movies/kalavaadiya-pozhuthugal-movie-review-a-film-that-stays-with-you-long-after-you-leave-the-theater-1618613.html&lt;/ref&gt; Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion wrote &quot;Elsewhere, we see more of Thangar Bachan’s anger... The director’s titles...and opening credits...stand testimony to his commitment to the Tamil language, and Kalavaadiya Pozhuthugal is suffused with the rage that others do not share his ardour.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.filmcompanion.in/kalavaadiya-pozhuthugal-movie-review/&lt;/ref&gt;
