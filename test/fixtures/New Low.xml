== Plot ==
Wendell, a neurotic, aimless twentysomething, struggles to figure out which girl he really belongs with: Joanna, the best girl he's ever known, or Vicky, the worst. His friend Dave helps him sort through his thoughts as Wendell discovers not only whom he should be with but who he truly is under all that neurosis.

== Reception==
''New Low'' has received mostly positive reception. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film &quot;hilarious&quot; and said it &quot;smells like a cult hit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117941996?refcatid=31 Variety review]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' rated it 3.5 out of 4 stars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newlowmovie.com/reviews.php New Low's Official Website's Review Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Independent Film Quarterly'' said, &quot;Easily containing some of the best film writing and dialogue over the past few years, ''New Low'' looks and feels like a [[Woody Allen]] -penned script filtered through a Slacker-era [[Richard Linklater]] visual sensibility.&quot;{{cn|date=March 2020}}

''[[The A.V. Club]]'' commented, &quot;Sharp, witty, frequently laugh-out-loud funny.&quot;{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

== Release ==
On January 17, 2011, the film was released digitally through a partnership between the [[Sundance Institute]] and [[New Video]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundance.org/nowplaying/film/new-low Sundance Institute's digital release of New Low]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also being self-distributed internationally on DVD through the movie's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newlowmovie.com New Low website]&lt;/ref&gt;
