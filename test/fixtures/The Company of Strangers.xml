{{distinguish|text=''The Company of Strangers: A Natural History of Economic Life'' by [[Paul Seabright]]}}
'''''The Company of Strangers''''' (US release title: '''''Strangers in Good Company'''''; French title: '''''Le Fabuleux gang des sept'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com Fabuleux gang des sept, Le, Angela Stukator, ''L'Encyclop√©die canadienne]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Canadian film, released in 1990. It was directed by [[Cynthia Scott]], and written by Scott, [[Sally Bochner]], [[David Wilson (producer)|David Wilson]] and [[Gloria Demers]]. The film depicts eight women on a bus tour, who are stranded at an isolated cottage when the bus breaks down.

Created in a genre defined as [[docufiction]], semi-documentary/semi-fiction,&lt;ref&gt;Diana, George. Semi-Documentary/Semi-Fiction: An Examination of Genre in &quot;Strangers in Good Company&quot;. Journal of Film and Video, v46 n4 p24-30 Win 1995&lt;/ref&gt; the film is not tightly scripted. The writers wrote a basic story outline but allowed the eight women to improvise their dialogue. Each of the women, all but one of whom were [[senior citizen]]s, told stories from her own life. A major theme of the film is how the elderly women each face aging and mortality in their own way, and find the courage together to persevere.

At various points throughout the film, a montage of photos from each woman's life is shown.

The women are:
* Alice Diabo, 74, a [[Mohawk Nation|Mohawk]] elder from [[Kahnawake, Quebec]],
* Constance Garneau, 88, born in the United States and brought to Quebec by her family as a child,
* Winifred Holden, 76, an Englishwoman who moved to Montreal after World War II,
* Cissy Meddings, 76, who was born in England and moved to Canada in 1981,
* [[Mary Meigs]], 74, a noted [[feminist]] writer and painter,
* Catherine Roche, 68, a Roman Catholic nun,
* [[Michelle Sweeney]], 27, a [[jazz]] singer and the bus trip's tour guide,
* Beth Webber, 80, who was born in England and moved to Montreal in 1930.

Meigs published a book about her experiences making the film, ''In the Company of Strangers'', in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/library/exhibits/mawrtyrs/meigs.html |title=Mary Meigs |work=Mawrtyrs |publisher=Bryn Mawr College |accessdate=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
