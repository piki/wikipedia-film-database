==Release and reception==
''I'm Not Harry Jenson'' premiered at the 2009 New Zealand International Film Festival, where it received strong reviews and sold out screenings, and held its international premiere at the 2009 Shanghai International Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1006/S00343/nz-film-lawyer-honoured-by-shanghai-film-festival.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''National Radio Film Review'' gave it 4 stars, calling it &quot;a remarkable result, doesn't feel like a feature debut but a thriller from the hands of an experienced player...an impressive piece of work&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/ninetonoon/audio/2202712/film-review-graeme-tuckett |title=Film review - Graeme Tuckett |work=Radio New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Voxy Movie Review]] gave it &quot;a very solid 7.5 out of 10&quot;, putting emphasis on the &quot;great writing, directing and in particular acting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.voxy.co.nz/entertainment/movie-review-im-not-harry-jenson/206/20525&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' gave the film three stars, calling it a &quot;small-scale whodunnit ... but shows how smart writing and good acting can compensate for a tiny budget&quot;. The review stated &quot;the young writer/director achieves moments of real tension&quot; with &quot;some wonderful lines&quot;, and the reveal was a &quot;scene of some mastery&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10622798 |title=I'm not Harry Jenson |work=The New Zealand Herald| author=Calder, Peter | date=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was released nationwide in theatres throughout New Zealand in 2010, but failed to do much business at the box office.
