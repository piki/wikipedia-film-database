'''''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers''''' is a 1954 American [[musical film]], photographed in [[Ansco Color]] in the [[CinemaScope]] format. The film was directed by [[Stanley Donen]], with music by [[Saul Chaplin]] and [[Gene de Paul]], lyrics by [[Johnny Mercer]], and choreography by [[Michael Kidd]]. The screenplay, by [[Albert Hackett]], [[Frances Goodrich]], and [[Dorothy Kingsley]], is based on the short story &quot;[[The Sobbin' Women]]&quot;, by [[Stephen Vincent Benét]], which was based in turn on the [[Ancient Roman]] legend of [[The Rape of the Sabine Women]]. ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'', which is set in [[Oregon]] in 1850, is particularly known for Kidd's unusual choreography, which makes dance numbers out of such mundane [[frontier]] pursuits as chopping wood and [[barn raising|raising a barn]]. Film critic Stephanie Zacharek has called the barn-raising sequence in ''Seven Brides'' &quot;one of the most rousing dance numbers ever put on screen.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dance Magazine&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=DEATHS: Michael Kidd (1915-2007)|author=Gold, Sylviane|journal=Dance Magazine|date=March 2008 |volume=82|issue=3|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'' won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Scoring of a Musical Picture]] and was nominated for four additional awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] (where it lost the award to [[Elia Kazan]]'s ''[[On the Waterfront]]''). In 2006, [[American Film Institute]] named ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'' as [[AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals|one of the best American musical films ever made]]. In 2004, ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'' was selected for preservation in the U.S. [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
In 1850, backwoodsman Adam Pontipee comes to town in the [[Oregon Territory]] to shop and look for a bride. He eventually comes upon the local tavern, where he sees Milly chopping wood. After being convinced of her worth by the quality of her cooking and her insistence on finishing her chores before she would leave with him, he proposes and she accepts despite knowing him for only a few hours.

On the journey home, Milly talks about how she is excited to be cooking and taking care of only one man, visibly upsetting Adam. When they arrive at his cabin in the mountains, Milly is surprised to learn that Adam is the oldest of seven brothers living under the same roof. The brothers have been given Bible names &quot;alphabetically&quot;: Adam, Benjamin, Caleb, Daniel, Ephraim, Frank (short for [[frankincense]]—supposedly due to no [[List of biblical names starting with F|Bible names beginning with F]]—and their mother thought he smelled sweet), and Gideon. All of the brothers have red hair, and all but Gideon are well over six feet tall. Milly is also shocked at how filthy dirty their house is, along with how bad-tempered and ill-mannered Adam and his brothers are. At first, Milly is angry and believes that Adam wanted a servant girl instead of a wife, but Adam tells her that living in the backwoods is a hard life, and men and women have to work alongside each other to survive.

The next morning, Milly decides to teach Adam and his brothers cleanliness and proper manners - especially at the table during meals. After the brothers wash and shave, Milly is shocked at how handsome they are, and that none of them got married. It turns out that the brothers rarely saw a girl or woman and never learned how to communicate with them. At first, the brothers have a hard time changing from their &quot;mountain man&quot; ways, but eventually come to see their only chance to get brides of their own is to do things Milly's way. They try out their new manners at a social gathering in the town (a dance and barn-raising), where they meet six women they like – Dorcas, Ruth, Martha, Liza, Sarah, and Alice. The girls take a fancy to the brothers as well. However, all of them already have suitors among the young men of the town, who taunt the brothers into fighting during the barn-raising. At first, the six brothers remember Milly's teachings and try to resist being drawn into a fight. The suitors finally go too far when they attack Adam, provoking Gideon into fighting back. A brawl ensues in which the brothers dominate their physically weaker town rivals. Although the Pontipee brothers did not start the fight, they are kicked out of the town by the townspeople.

Winter comes, and the six younger brothers are pining for the girls they had fallen in love with. Milly asks Adam to talk to the brothers as she fears they will want to leave because of missing the girls. Adam reads his brothers the story of &quot;The Sobbin' Women&quot; (taken from [[Plutarch]]'s story of [[The Rape of the Sabine Women|the Sabine Women]]), from the Bible Milly had brought to the homestead. He tells them that they should take whatever action is necessary to get their women.

Aided by Adam, the brothers kidnap the six girls, then cause an avalanche in Echo Pass so the townspeople can't pursue them. The Pontipee homestead is cut off from the town until the spring thaw opens Echo Pass again. The only problem: The brothers forgot to bring the parson along to perform the marriages. Milly is furious with Adam and his brothers for kidnapping the women, and she kicks both Adam and his brothers out of their house and sends them to the barn to &quot;eat and sleep with the rest of the livestock,&quot; while the women stay in the house with her. 
Adam, angered by Milly's action, leaves for the trapping cabin farther up the mountain to spend the winter by himself. Gideon tells Milly and begs her to tell Adam not to leave, but Milly refuses, saying: &quot;He's gotta learn that he can't treat people this way.&quot;

Winter slowly passes, and the women vent their frustrations by pulling pranks on the brothers. After Milly announces that she's going to have a baby, the women and the brothers come together as a family. Milly gives birth to a daughter, in the spring. The daughter is named as Hanna as a continuum to the names in alphabetical order, the last one being Gideon. Gideon rides to the cabin to inform Adam of his daughter's arrival and asks him to come home. Adam refuses, saying that he had said he would return home when the pass was open.

Adam does return home, when Echo Pass comes open, to reconcile with Milly and meet his new daughter. As a newly responsible father, he has become aware of how worried the townspeople would be about what has happened to the six abducted girls. Adam admits that ''he'' would have hung his daughter's kidnapper(s) on the nearest tree; Milly forgives him for his past behavior.

Adam tells his brothers they need to return the women to their families; the brothers are unwilling, believing their parents won't let them marry their daughters, and the other six women refuse to return to their families, lest their parents to force them to return to their former suitors;  they ran away to hide.  When Milly discovers that they are not in the house, Adam tells the brothers to find them and bring them back.

The townspeople arrive, intent on hanging the Pontipee brothers for the kidnappings. The fathers, who find the brothers trying to force the women to return to town, misunderstand their efforts as assautive, and charge to the girls' rescue.

Alice's father, Reverend Elcott ([[Ian Wolfe]]) -- the minister the brothers had forgotten to grab when they took the girls—hears baby Hannah cry in the distance, and worries that the baby might belong to one of the kidnapped girls. Elcott asks the girls whose baby he heard, and to not be afraid to tell. They each answer &quot;Mine.&quot; This misinformation serves the women's and the brothers' needs: the townspeople, including the girls' fathers, insist on immediate  [[shotgun wedding]]s, which are performed by Reverend Elcott, while Adam and Milly watch and the fathers stand behind their respective daughters' grooms, guns over their arms. The film ends with the brothers kissing their respective brides in the living room of the Pontipee cabin.

===Brothers===
&lt;!-- Please do not change the colors of the shirts which Daniel and Ephraim wore.  Daniel (Marc Platt) wore a mauve shirt – while Ephraim (Jacques d'Amboise) wore a dark green shirt.  There are clues in the movie to confirm this (please check the talk page for this film). --&gt;

To perform the dance numbers and action sequences, choreographer [[Michael Kidd]] wanted dancers to portray all six of Adam Pontipee's brothers. Kidd said that he &quot;had to find a way to have these backwoods men dance without looking ridiculous. I had to base it all around activities you would accept from such people&amp;nbsp;– it couldn't look like ballet. And it could only have been done by superbly trained dancers.&quot; However, he was able to integrate into the cast two non-dancer MGM contract players who were assigned to the film, Jeff Richards, who performed just the simpler dance numbers, and [[Russ Tamblyn]], using him in the dance numbers by exploiting his talents as a gymnast and tumbler.&lt;ref name=&quot;Variety 1997&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Kidd embraced by the Academy | work=Variety | date=March 3–9, 1997 | author=Gilbert, Tom | pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/16147/Seven-Brides-for-Seven-Brothers/articles.html TCM's article about ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The other four brothers were portrayed by professional dancers&amp;nbsp;– Matt Mattox, Marc Platt, Tommy Rall, and Jacques d'Amboise.  All four balanced on a beam together during their barn-raising dance.

The wood-chopping scene in ''Lonesome Polecat'' was filmed in a single take.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 1996, p.194&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Adam''' (''light green shirt''): Howard Keel, a professional singer, appeared as the eldest of the seven brothers.

* '''Benjamin''' (''orange shirt''): Jeff Richards was a former professional [[baseball]] player who topped out at the AAA level of the minor leagues. Although obviously athletic, he is noticeably in the background, seated, or standing during the dance numbers so as to not expose his lesser dancing skills. This often relegated his partner, the classically trained ballet dancer [[Julie Newmar]], to the background as well.&lt;ref&gt;Filming notes in the DVD anniversary edition&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Caleb''' (''yellow shirt''): Matt Mattox, a professional dancer, appeared on stage on Broadway and also danced in many Hollywood musical films. His singing voice for the film was dubbed by [[Bill Lee (singer)|Bill Lee]].

* '''Ephraim''' (''dark green shirt''): Jacques d'Amboise, a principal dancer with New York City Ballet, was given special leave for the filming of ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'' (although he was recalled before filming was completed).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-ballet.com/damboise.php Jacques d'Amboise - Ballet Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;  He also danced in other musical films, including the ballet role of the ''Starlight Carnival'' &quot;[[barker (occupation)|barker]]&quot; in the film ''[[Carousel (film)|Carousel]]'' (in which he partnered [[Susan Luckey]] in ''Louise's ballet''). The [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] and [[Tony Award]] winning documentary film, ''[[He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin']]'' is about Jacques d'Amboise and his teaching children how to dance.
* '''Frank''' (''red shirt''): Tommy Rall, a professional dancer and singer, appeared on stage on Broadway and in many musical films. These included the role of ''Bill Calhoun'' ''(Lucentio)'' in the film version of ''[[Kiss Me Kate (film)|Kiss Me Kate]]''&amp;nbsp;– and as one of the Gallini brothers in the film ''[[Merry Andrew (film)|Merry Andrew]]'' (including him being one of the three featured [[Acro dance|acrobatic dancers]] in the circus engagement scene&amp;nbsp;– Tommy Rall is the dancer in the center wearing the red shirt).

==Production==
Choreographer Michael Kidd originally turned down the film, recalling in 1997: &quot;Here are these slobs living off in the woods. They have no schooling, they are uncouth, there's manure on the floor, the cows come in and out&amp;nbsp;– and they're gonna get up and dance? We'd be laughed out of the house.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Michael Kidd | work=The Independent | date=29 December 2007 | pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyricist Johnny Mercer said that the musical numbers were written at Kidd's behest, as an example &quot;of how a songwriter sometimes has to take his cue from his collaborators.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Songs of Hollywood&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1NVcYC2cHk4C&amp;pg=PA188 | title=The Songs of Hollywood | publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |author1=Furia, Philip  |author2=Patterson, Laurie  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2010 | pages=188 | isbn=0195337085}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Kidd explained to Mercer and dePaul his conception of the &quot;Lonesome Polecat&quot; number, the lament of the brothers for the women, and the two worked out the music and lyrics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Songs of Hollywood&quot; /&gt;

In his introduction to a showing on Turner Classic Movies on January 17, 2009, host [[Robert Osborne]], as well as [[Jane Powell]] in her autobiography, ''The Girl Next Door,'' both say MGM was much less interested in ''Seven Brides'' than it was in ''[[Brigadoon (film)|Brigadoon]]'' which was also filming at the time, even cutting its budget and transferring the money to the [[Lerner and Loewe]] vehicle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane Powell Autobiography&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Powell |first1=Jane |title=The Girl Next Door...and How She Grew |edition=1st |year=1988 |isbn=0-688-06757-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the movie was shot on the MGM sound stages. One exterior sequence not filmed at the studio was shot on location at Corral Creek Canyon in Sun Valley, Idaho. It was here that the escape following the brothers' kidnapping their future brides and the avalanche that closed the pass was filmed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047472/trivia?ref_=tt_ql_2. Retrieved December 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 2004 DVD commentary, Stanley Donen states that the film was originally shot in two versions, one in [[CinemaScope]] and another in normal ratio, because MGM was concerned that not all theaters had the capability to screen it.  Despite the fact that it cost more than the widescreen version to make, he says, the other version was never used.  However both versions are available on the 2004 DVD release.

The dresses worn by the female cast were made from old quilts that costume designer [[Walter Plunkett]] found at [[the Salvation Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane Powell Autobiography&quot; /&gt;

==Songs and music==

The &quot;Main Title&quot; is a medley of the songs &quot;Sobbin' Women&quot;, &quot;Bless Your Beautiful Hide&quot; and &quot;Wonderful, Wonderful Day&quot;.

In the film, Matt Mattox's voice is dubbed in by Bill Lee on &quot;Lonesome Polecat&quot;. Mattox can be heard singing the song on the soundtrack album.

== Reception ==
Contemporary reviews from critics were positive. [[A. H. Weiler]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film &quot;a wholly engaging, bouncy, tuneful and panchromatic package ... Although the powers at M-G-M are deviating from the normal song-and-dance extravaganza in 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,' it is a gamble that is paying rich rewards.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weiler |first=A. H. |date=July 23, 1954 |title=The Screen in Review |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote: &quot;This is a happy, hand-clapping, foot-stomping, country type of musical with all the slickness of a Broadway show. It offers songs, dances and romancing in such a delightful package that word-of-mouth could talk it into solid business at the boxoffice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=June 2, 1954 |title=Seven Brides for Seven Brothers |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard L. Coe]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' declared: &quot;Dandy dancing, singable songs and the ozone of originality make 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers' the niftiest musical I've seen in months.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coe |first=Richard L. |date=August 21, 1954 |title=Seven Big Cheers For Seven Brides |journal=[[The Washington Post]] |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' called it &quot;A thoroughly delightful blend of songs, dances and romantic comedy&quot; with &quot;exceptionally good musical numbers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=June 5, 1954 |title='Seven Brides for Seven Brothers' with Howard Keel and Jane Powell |journal=[[Harrison's Reports]] |page=90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' wrote that the dances &quot;give the picture its remarkably spirited and exhilarating quality ... A minor weakness is the playing of Jane Powell, whose Milly is a somewhat colourless figure; Howard Keel, the brides and the brothers, however, are all admirable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=December 1954 |title=Seven Brides for Seven Brothers |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=21 |issue=251 |pages=175–176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John McCarten]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' posted a dissenting negative review, writing that the film &quot;got on my nerves&quot; and &quot;struck me as desperately contrived and often witless,&quot; though he did concede that there were &quot;some fine dances&quot; in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCarten |first=John |date=July 31, 1954 |title=The Current Cinema |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |page=53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
