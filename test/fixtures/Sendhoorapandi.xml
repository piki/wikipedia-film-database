==Reception==
''The Indian Express'' wrote it &quot;turns out to be fairly engaging film&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=P9oYG7HA76QC&amp;dat=19931217&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en |title=Few dull moments |page=6 |last=Mannath |first=Malini |date=December 17, 1993 |newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''New Straits Times'' wrote &quot;It is amazing Chandrasegaran went into production without a proper story. Rajarajan's cinematography is the saving grace in this movie which seems to have nothing new to say&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=x8G803Bi31IC&amp;dat=19940219&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en |title=Tired old village love plot in Chandrasegaran's latest |date=February 19, 1994 |newspaper=New Straits Times |page=12 |access-date=2019-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
