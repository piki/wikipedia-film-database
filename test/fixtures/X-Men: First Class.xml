'''''X-Men: First Class''''' (stylized onscreen as '''''X: First Class''''') is a 2011 American [[superhero film]], based on the [[X-Men]] characters appearing in [[Marvel Comics]]. The fifth installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], the film was directed by [[Matthew Vaughn]] and produced by [[Bryan Singer]]. The story is set primarily in 1962 during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and focuses on the relationship between [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] ([[James McAvoy]]), and [[Magneto (comics)|Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto]] ([[Michael Fassbender]]), and the origin of their groups—the [[X-Men]] and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], respectively, as they deal with the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] led by [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] ([[Kevin Bacon]]), who is bent on world domination. The film co-stars [[Rose Byrne]], [[January Jones]], and [[Oliver Platt]]. The film also introduces new actors to the series including [[Nicholas Hoult]] and [[Jennifer Lawrence]] who, like McAvoy and Fassbender, reimagine popular characters from the franchise ([[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]) that were already established in the original trilogy.

Producer [[Lauren Shuler Donner]] first thought of a prequel based on the young X-Men during the production of ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', and later producer [[Simon Kinberg]] suggested to [[20th Century Fox]] an adaptation of the comic series ''[[X-Men: First Class (comics)|X-Men: First Class]]'', though the film does not follow the comic closely. Singer, who had directed both ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' and ''X2'', became involved with the project in 2009, but he could only produce and co-write ''First Class'' due to other projects. Matthew Vaughn, who was previously attached to both ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', became the director, and also wrote the final script with his writing partner [[Jane Goldman]]. ''First Class'' overtook a planned Magneto prequel that entered [[development hell]] and the [[Writers Guild of America West|Writers Guild of America]] [[WGA screenwriting credit system|arbitration]] gave a story credit to ''Magneto'' writer [[Sheldon Turner]].

''First Class'' entered production in August 2010, with [[principal photography]] concluding in December and additional filming finishing in April 2011, just a few weeks before the film's premiere in June 2011. The tight schedule proved a challenge to the six companies responsible for the extensive visual effects, which included computer-generated sets and digital doubles for the actors. Locations included [[Oxford]], the [[Mojave Desert]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], with soundstage work done in both [[Pinewood Studios]] and the [[20th Century Fox]] stages in [[Los Angeles]]. The depiction of the 1960s drew inspiration from the [[James Bond in film|James Bond films]] of the period.

''First Class'' was a box-office success, becoming the seventh highest-grossing in the film series, and received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its acting, screenplay, direction, action sequences, visual effects, and musical score. The film's success spawned a number of sequels focusing on younger iterations of the X-Men characters, with ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014), ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' (2016), and the upcoming ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|X-Men: Dark Phoenix]]'' (2019).

==Plot==
&lt;!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. --&gt;
In 1944, in a [[German camps in occupied Poland during World War II|Nazi death camp]], [[Nazism|Nazi]] scientist Klaus Schmidt witnesses young prisoner [[Magneto (comics)|Erik Lehnsherr]] bending a metal gate with his mind when he is separated from his parents. In his office, Schmidt orders Lehnsherr to move a coin on his desk, and kills the boy's mother when Lehnsherr fails to do so. In grief and rage, Lehnsherr's magnetic power manifests, killing two guards and destroying the room. Meanwhile, in a mansion in [[Westchester County, New York]], child [[telepathy|telepath]] [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] meets young shapeshifter [[Mystique (comics)|Raven]], whose natural form is blue-skinned and scaly. Overjoyed to meet someone &quot;different&quot;, like himself, he invites her to live with his family as his foster sister.

In 1962, Lehnsherr is tracking down Schmidt, while Xavier graduates from the [[University of Oxford]]. In [[Las Vegas]], [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer [[Moira MacTaggert]] follows U.S. Army Colonel Hendry into the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], where she sees Schmidt—now known as [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]—with mutant telepath [[Emma Frost]], cyclone-producing [[Riptide (comics)|Riptide]], and [[teleportation|teleporter]] [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]]. Threatened by Shaw and teleported by Azazel to the [[National Military Command Center|Joint War Room]], Hendry advocates deployment of [[nuclear missile]]s in [[Turkey (country)|Turkey]]. Shaw, an energy-absorbing mutant whose powers have de-aged him, later kills Hendry.

MacTaggert, seeking Xavier's advice on mutation, takes him and Raven to the CIA, where they convince Director &lt;!-- He is only credited as McCone in the film --&gt;McCone that mutants exist and Shaw is a threat. Another CIA officer sponsors the mutants and invites them to the secret &quot;Division X&quot; facility. MacTaggert and Xavier find Shaw as Lehnsherr is attacking him on his yacht, and rescue Lehnsherr from drowning, while Shaw escapes in a submarine. Xavier brings Lehnsherr to Division X, where they meet young scientist [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]], a mutant with [[prehensile feet]], who believes Raven's DNA may provide a &quot;cure&quot; for their appearance. Xavier uses McCoy's mutant-locating device [[Cerebro]] to seek recruits against Shaw. Xavier and Lehnsherr recruit stripper [[Angel Salvadore]], cabbie [[Darwin (comics)|Armando Muñoz]], Army prisoner [[Havok (comics)|Alex Summers]], and runaway [[Banshee (comics)|Sean Cassidy]].

When Frost meets with a Soviet general in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and uses her telepathic powers to pretend to have sex with him, Xavier and Lehnsherr capture Frost and discover that Shaw intends to start [[World War III]] that will trigger mutant ascendancy and the extinction of the human race. Azazel, Riptide and Shaw attack Division X, killing everyone but the mutants, whom Shaw invites to join him. Salvadore accepts; and when Summers and Muñoz retaliate, Shaw kills Muñoz. In Moscow, Shaw compels the general to have the USSR [[Cuban Missile Crisis|install missiles]] in [[Cuba]]. Wearing a helmet that blocks telepathy, Shaw follows the Soviet fleet in a submarine to ensure the missiles break a US blockade.

Raven, thinking McCoy is attracted to her in her natural form, tells him not to use the cure. When she later attempts to seduce Lehnsherr by taking the forms of various women, Lehnsherr tells her she is beautiful as she is, in her natural mutant form. McCoy uses the cure on himself but it backfires, giving him blue fur and leonine aspects. With McCoy piloting, the mutants and MacTaggert take a jet to the blockade line, where Xavier uses his telepathy to influence a Soviet sailor to destroy the ship carrying the missiles, and Lehnsherr uses his magnetic power to lift Shaw's submarine from the water and deposit it on land. During the ensuing battle, Lehnsherr seizes Shaw's helmet, allowing Xavier to immobilize Shaw. Lehnsherr tells Shaw he shares Shaw's [[Chosen people|exclusivist]] view of mutants but, to avenge his mother, kills Shaw—over Xavier's objections—by forcing the Nazi coin from his childhood through Shaw's brain, causing massive pain to Xavier in the process.

Fearing the mutants, both fleets fire missiles at them, which Lehnsherr turns back in mid-flight. MacTaggert tries to stop Lehnsherr by shooting him but he deflects the bullets, one of which hits Xavier in the spine. Lehnsherr rushes to help Xavier and, distracted, allows the missiles to fall harmlessly into the ocean. Parting with Xavier over their differing views on the relationship between mutants and humans, Lehnsherr leaves with Salvadore, Azazel, Riptide and Mystique. Later, a wheelchair-bound Xavier and his mutants are at the [[mansion|X Mansion]], where he intends to open a school. MacTaggert promises never to reveal his location and they kiss. When they kiss, Xavier uses his powers and erases their memories from her mind. Elsewhere, Lehnsherr, now wearing Shaw's helmet, frees Frost from confinement and introduces himself as &quot;Magneto&quot;.

:The telepathic mutant leader and founder of the [[X-Men]]. He is a close friend of Erik Lehnsherr until their differing views of mutantkind's place in humanity create a schism between them. McAvoy was Vaughn's top choice for Xavier, and, after being cast, auditioned with every actor considered for Magneto to test the duo's chemistry.&lt;ref name=geek/&gt; McAvoy said he did not read comic books as a child, but added that he was a fan of the [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' cartoons]] from the age of 10. While he describes the older Charles Xavier as &quot;a monk ... a selfless, egoless almost sexless force for the betterment of humanity and mortality&quot;, he says that the younger Xavier is a very different person: &quot;It's quite fun because the complete opposite of that is an ego-fueled, sexed up self-serving dude. And not going too far with it, but he's definitely got an ego and he's definitely got a sex drive as well.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McAvoy interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Tilly |first=Chris |date=March 30, 2011 |title=X-Men: First Class: James McAvoy Interview |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/03/30/x-men-first-class-james-mcavoy-interview?page=1 |publisher=[[IGN]] |access-date=May 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McAvoy admitted to feeling similarities between Xavier/Magneto and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]/[[Malcolm X]], stating that the film was &quot;sort of like meeting them at a point where they are still finding out who they are and you are still seeing some of the events that shaped them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/03/30/x-men-first-class-james-mcavoy-interview?page=2 | title=X-Men: First Class: James McAvoy Interview page 2 | publisher=IGN | date=March 30, 2011 | access-date=June 5, 2012 | author=Tilly, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt; McAvoy avoided doing any callbacks to [[Patrick Stewart]]'s performance as Xavier as Vaughn told him and Michael Fassbender to only take the allusion to Xavier and Magneto's old friendship in the other movies as inspiration.&lt;ref name=hitfix/&gt; Vaughn stated that since he considered that Professor X was &quot;a bit of a pious, sanctimonious boring character, and he's got too much fucking power&quot;, the script would make young Xavier more interesting by &quot;making him more of a rogue&quot; who would become more responsible as his mission of finding more mutants went on.&lt;ref name=geek/&gt;

:A mutant capable of manipulating and generating electromagnetic fields. He becomes Xavier's friend and ally until their philosophical differences create a schism between them. Fassbender had auditioned for an earlier Matthew Vaughn project, and the director had remembered him and sent Fassbender the ''X-Men'' script. Though Fassbender knew little of the superhero team, he became interested in the part after reading the script and familiarizing himself with Magneto in the comic books. Fassbender, who considered Lehnsherr as a [[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]] character who is neither good nor evil, watched Sir [[Ian McKellen]]'s performances to get the flavor of Magneto, but ultimately chose to &quot;paint a new canvas&quot; with the character, &quot;just going my own way and working with whatever is in the comic books and the script.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fassbender interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Tilly |first=Chris |title=X-Men: First Class – Michael Fassbender Interview |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/116/1161582p1.html |publisher=[[IGN]] |access-date=May 13, 2011 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120604000000/http://movies.ign.com/articles/116/1161582p1.html |archive-date= June 4, 2012 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaughn said Lehnsherr &quot;is straight up cool; he's [[Han Solo]] while Professor X is [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=ext&gt;{{Cite video|title=Extraordinary Abilities|publisher=20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|location=''X-Men: First Class'' DVD|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The onscreen credits spell the character's name as &quot;Lensherr&quot;.

He enjoyed playing a villain as most of his film roles in Spain were for &quot;good guys&quot;, and compared Riptide's respectable and polite personality, which can suddenly be dropped to perform fierce attacks, to a hurricane; in a translation of a Portuguese-language interview, he is quoted as saying, &quot;When I see a hurricane from far, it is calm.

==Production==

===Development===
During the production of ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', producer [[Lauren Shuler Donner]] had discussed the idea of a film focusing on the young X-Men with the crew, which was met with approval; the concept was revived during the production of ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''.&lt;ref name=atom1/&gt; One of ''The Last Stand''{{'}}s writers, [[Zak Penn]], was hired to write and direct this spin-off,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Douglas, Edward | url = http://www.superherohype.com/features/90651-zak-penn-on-his-potential-x-men-spin-off | title = Zak Penn on His Potential X-Men Spin-off | publisher=SuperheroHype.com | date = April 11, 2006 | accessdate =December 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this idea later fell through.&lt;ref name=erikdavis&gt;{{cite news | author=Davis, Erik | title = Zak Penn Talks X-Men Spin-Off, Incredible Hulk Casting | publisher=&quot;Cinematical&quot; (column) [[Moviefone]] ([[AOL]]) | date = May 1, 2007 | url = http://blog.moviefone.com/2007/05/01/zak-penn-talks-x-men-spin-off-incredible-hulk-casting-with-cine/ | accessdate=February 9, 2008 | archivedate= June 4, 2012 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68B8WIM5f?url=http://blog.moviefone.com/2007/05/01/zak-penn-talks-x-men-spin-off-incredible-hulk-casting-with-cine/ | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Penn explained in 2007 that &quot;the original idea was to have me do a young X-Men spin-off, a spin-off of the young X-Men characters.

Around the same time, in December 2004, [[20th Century Fox]] hired screenwriter [[Sheldon Turner]] to draft a spin-off ''X-Men'' film, and he chose to write ''Magneto'', pitching it as &quot;''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'' meets ''X-Men''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Michael Fleming |author2=Claude Brodesser | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117914863.html?categoryid=1238&amp;cs=1 | title=Fox pages Turner to pen Magneto spinoff pic | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=December 12, 2004 | accessdate=April 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Turner, the script he penned was set from 1939 to 1955,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Michelle Kung | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1008429,00.html | title=Checking in with ...

As producer [[Simon Kinberg]] read the comic series ''[[X-Men: First Class (comics)|X-Men: First Class]]'', he suggested studio [[20th Century Fox]] to adapt it.

The producers listed various possible directors, but at first did not consider [[Matthew Vaughn]] because he started working on ''The Last Stand'' before backing out. After seeing Vaughn's satirical superhero film ''[[Kick-Ass (film)|Kick-Ass]]'' (2010), Kinberg decided to contact Vaughn to see if he would be interested in ''First Class''.&lt;ref name=atom1/&gt; When Fox offered Vaughn the &quot;chance to reboot X-Men and put your stamp all over it&quot;, he first thought the studio was joking, but accepted after discovering that it was to be set in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=hype&gt;{{cite web|last=Douglas|first=Edward|title=Exclusive Interview with X-Men: First Class Director Matthew Vaughn|url=http://www.superherohype.com/features/167401-exclusive-interview-with-x-men-first-class-director-matthew-vaughn|publisher=Superhero Hype|accessdate=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director stated that ''First Class'' would become the opportunity to combine many of his dream projects: &quot;I [[You can't have your cake and eat it|got my cake and ate it]], managed to do an ''X-Men'' movie, and a [[James Bond|Bond]] thing, and a [[John Frankenheimer|Frankenheimer]] political thriller at the same time&quot;.&lt;ref name=geek/&gt; Vaughn signed on as Singer's replacement in May 2010, and Fox subsequently announced a June 3, 2011 release date.&lt;ref name=prequel&gt;{{cite news | author=McClintock, Pamela | url = https://variety.com/2010/film/news/x-men-prequel-to-open-june-3-2011-1118018752/2 | title = 'X-Men' prequel to open June 04, 2011|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = May 5, 2010 | accessdate=December 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaughn also rewrote the script with his screenwriting partner [[Jane Goldman]], adding new characters and changing existing character arcs and dynamics—for instance, the idea of a love triangle between Xavier, Magneto and Moira MacTaggert was cut.&lt;ref name=atom1/&gt; The character of [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] was also cut, as the director felt that &quot;we didn't have enough time or money&quot; to make the character work. Vaughn and Goldman considered including mentions to the [[civil rights movement]], but ultimately the director felt that &quot;I had enough political subplot in this movie&quot;. Vaughn stated that his biggest concern was to both make Erik and Charles' friendship believable given the short timespan of the film, and on how the character of Magneto was built—&quot;Shaw was the villain, but now you're seeing all those elements of Shaw going into Magneto.&quot;&lt;ref name=geek/&gt; An action scene that was to have been set in a dream sequence with revolving rooms was scrapped after the release of ''[[Inception]]'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/inception-wakeup-call-xmen-first-class-forced-to-jettison-dream-scenes/|title='Inception' wake-up call – 'X-Men: First Class' director jettisons similar dream-time scenes |date=September 2, 2010|first=Geoff|last=Boucher|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate=September 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing his thought process towards the material, Vaughn said he was motivated by &quot;unfinished business&quot; with Marvel, having been previously involved with the production of both ''X-Men: The Last Stand''&lt;ref name=hype/&gt; and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''.&lt;ref name=slashfilm/&gt; Vaughn declared that he was more enthusiastic about ''First Class'' than ''The Last Stand'' due to not being constrained by the previous installments, and having the opportunity to &quot;start fresh&quot;, while &quot;nodding towards&quot; the successful elements from those films.&lt;ref name=slashfilm/&gt; Vaughn compared ''First Class'' to both ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005), which restarted a franchise with an unseen approach,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Tilly| first = Chris | title= X-Men: First Class Set Visit | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/03/09/x-men-first-class-set-visit|publisher=IGN|date=March 9, 2011|accessdate=May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' film, which paid homage to the original source material while taking it in a new direction with a fresh, young cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = White | first = Cindy | title = X-Men Following Star Trek's Lead | publisher=[[IGN]] | date = August 2, 2010 | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/08/02/x-men-following-star-treks-lead | accessdate = August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding continuity, Vaughn said his intention was &quot;to make as good a film that could stand on its own two feet regardless of all the other films&quot; and also that could &quot;[[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] and start a whole new X-Men franchise&quot;.&lt;ref name=slashfilm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/film-interview-xmen-class-director-matthew-vaughn/|title=/Film Interview: 'X-Men: First Class' Director Matthew Vaughn|publisher=[[/Film]]|date=May 25, 2011|first=Germain|last=Lussier|accessdate=December 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman added the film was kind of an &quot;[[alternate history]]&quot; for the X-Men, saying that while rebooting, the writers did not want to go fully &quot;against the [[canon (fiction)|canon]] of the ''X-Men'' trilogy&quot;, comparing to the various approaches the comic had in over fifty years of publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1283|title=X-Men: First Class Interviews|first=Helen|last=O'Hara|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|accessdate=December 25, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614124620/http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1283|archivedate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film also rescues a central concept in the comics, the fact that radiation is one of the causes of genetic mutation in the ''X-Men'' fictional universe, and incorporates it in the storyline, resurrecting the concept which went unused in the last years, as writers in the comics more recently have attributed the phenomenon of mutation mostly to evolution and natural selection.

[[File:X-MEN First Class.JPG|thumb|left|Filming of the naval battle scenes.|alt=A battleship fires its guns while surrounded by helicopters and a crane.]]
The 1960s setting of ''X-Men: First Class'', technologically inspired by the [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' films]] of that era, also added to the international feel of the characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harry&quot;&gt;{{cite news | authorlink = Harry Knowles | last = Knowles | first = Harry | url = http://aintitcool.com/node/46217 | title = So Bryan Singer just called regarding Matthew Vaughn's X-Men: First Class ...

I wanted there to be just a hint of this world of the mutants coming through. A mutant in this world having powers needed to be the equivalent of you or I sneezing, as normal as possible, at least until the humans start seeing it for the first time.&quot;&lt;ref name=hitfix/&gt; At the same time, Vaughn tried to do the &quot;bloody hard balancing&quot; of modern and antique to recreate the 1960s in way it was &quot;not so alien to the kids that it looked like a [[Historical period drama|period piece]].&quot;&lt;ref name=atom5/&gt; The director also tried to depict the era still in a realistic way, particularly &quot;that '60s [[Misogyny|misogynist]] vibe&quot; with women in skimpy suits, and McTaggert's reliability as a CIA agent being questioned.&lt;ref name=geek/&gt; There is also a nod to the 1950s and 60s in the scenes set in &quot;Oxford University&quot;, starting with the &quot;heterochromia scene&quot;. These are set in a pub called &quot;the Eagle&quot;, next to the famous [[Bridge_of_Sighs_(Oxford)|&quot;Bridge of Sighs&quot;]] in Oxford, but there is no such pub. This seems to be a reference to the [[The_Eagle,_Cambridge|Eagle pub in Cambridge]], where Crick and Watson infamously announced their solution to the [[DNA#History|structure of DNA]] (in 1953), very relevant to the themes of the film.

Vaughn said he shot the film in a way which resembled the productions of the 1960s, with &quot;very traditional framing, and camera movement when it needs to move, not just throwing it around and whizz-bang&quot;,&lt;ref name=geek/&gt; and using the [[anamorphic format]] &quot;to create a widescreen experience, which is emblematic of '60s movies, such as the ''James Bond'' films&quot;.&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt; The director had to hire five [[cinematographer]]s - with sole credit being given to [[John Mathieson (cinematographer)|John Mathieson]], who came halfway through the shoot and did &quot;forty-five percent, fifty-five percent&quot; of the film—and four [[assistant director]]s to successfully convey the look he wanted for the film.&lt;ref name=geek/&gt;&lt;ref name=hitfix/&gt; Visual effects supervisor Matt Johnson added that for the lighting of the digital interior of Cerebro, &quot;keeping with the '60s vibe, we put in some old school elements such as [[lens flare]] and [[chromatic aberration]] and [[Purple fringing|edge fringing]].&quot;&lt;ref name=cinefex&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.digital.cinefex.com/nxtbooks/cinefex/126/#/96|title=First Class Effects|first=Jody|last=Duncan|journal=Cinefex|issue=126|date=July 2011|pages=96–120|accessdate=June 5, 2012}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetics of the decade were also invoked by designers Simon Clowes and Kyle Cooper of Prologue Films, who were responsible for the end credits and tried to do something that &quot;could be done with traditional optical&quot;. The credits animation depicts DNA strands through simple geometric shapes, drawing inspiration from both [[Saul Bass]] and [[Maurice Binder]]'s work in the ''Bond'' films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Retro Cool|publisher=20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|location=''X-Men: First Class'' DVD|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin story made the X-Men costumes resemble the ones in the original comics, while still being functional, with the yellow parts resembling [[Kevlar]] and the blue looking like [[ballistic nylon]], and resembling 1962 apparel in both the fabrics and the &quot;[[Space Age]] fashion&quot;. The costumes tried to convey the character personalities—for instance, Xavier wore loose clothes, and Emma Frost's costumes were white and shimmery.

''First Class'' employed 1,150 [[visual effects]] shots,&lt;ref name=awn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/vfxworld/going-deeper-x-mens-origins|title=Going Deeper into X-Men's Origins|date=June 11, 2011 |first=Bill|last=Desowitz|publisher=Animation World Network|accessdate=October 29, 2011 | page=[http://www.awn.com/articles/going-deeper-x-mens-origins/page/2%2C1 2] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68Awfebgd?url=http://www.awn.com/articles/going-deeper-x-mens-origins | archivedate= June 4, 2012 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was done by six companies:&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt; [[Rhythm and Hues Studios|Rhythm and Hues]] was responsible for Emma Frost, Mystique and Angel, as well as set extensions; [[Cinesite]] handled Azazel, the visuals for Cerebro and environment effects; [[Luma Pictures]] did Banshee, Havok and Darwin; [[Moving Picture Company]] did Beast, Riptide, and the scene where Shaw's yacht is destroyed and he escapes in a submarine; [[Digital Domain]] created Sebastian Shaw's powers, and [[Weta Digital]] was responsible for the climactic battle in Cuba.&lt;ref name=fxguide/&gt; The overall coordination was provided by visual effects designer [[John Dykstra]], who said the biggest difficulty was the tight schedule: &quot;It was slightly less than a year and I've never done anything like that before (''[[Spider-Man in film|Spider-Man]]'' was frequently two years).&quot;&lt;ref name=awn/&gt; British company 4dMax employed special [[3D scanner]]s to digitize data of the sets and actors which would be used by the effects companies.&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt; This allowed for computer-generated sets such as the mirrored nuclear reactor where Magneto battles Shaw&lt;ref name=awn/&gt;—for which the effects team used the mirror maze fight in ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' as a reference—and the domed walls of Cerebro. Digital models of Washington and Moscow were also created based on photographs of the actual cities,&lt;ref name=fxguide/&gt; with the Russian one in particular having vehicles and military hardware based on videos of a 1962 [[Red Square]], and a digital army doing an actual Soviet-style [[military step|march]]. With the exception of scenes featuring the actors on ships (shot on a small [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] set) and the X-Jet (done on a set replicating the front two-thirds of the aircraft, which was mounted atop a roller wheel so it could be spun) the naval battle was entirely digital, featuring a simulated ocean and high resolution 3D models of the X-Jet, Shaw's submarine and 16 warships. The designs were mostly based on real vehicles, with the jet being a modified [[SR-71 Blackbird]], the submarine a combination of various models from the 1940s and 1950s, and replicas of the actual US and USSR fleets in the 1960s—though a few were not in service in 1962. A particular Soviet cruiser was a larger version of the ''[[Kresta I-class cruiser|Kresta I]]'' and ''[[Kresta II-class cruiser|II]]'', leading Weta to dub it the ''Kresta III''.&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt; [[Practical effects]] were still used whenever possible, such as having on location most of the objects young Erik throws after his mother's death, actors and stuntmen dangled from wires, and real explosions and light effects as reference for Havok's beams.&lt;ref name=ext/&gt;

While in the comics Shaw's absorption power was depicted by having him grow up to ten times his original size, ''First Class'' instead does what company [[Digital Domain]] called a &quot;kinetic echo&quot;, where a digital Kevin Bacon would be rippled, deformed and at times multiplied in repeated &quot;iterations&quot; that appear in a short period, to &quot;see [Shaw] displace and deform in a kinetic and organic way&quot;.&lt;ref name=ext/&gt; According to Dykstra, the biggest problem with Frost's diamond body was depicting it &quot;without looking like she was made of [[Jell-O]] or the [[Polygon mesh|polygon model]] of a human being&quot;.&lt;ref name=awn/&gt; The morphed Frost, which the visual effects tried to make look more like a faceted crystal than glass,&lt;ref name=awn/&gt; was [[rotoscoping|rotomated]] into Jones in the live-action plates, while still retaining the actress' eyes and lips.&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt; As the character kept on going in and out of her diamond form, a [[motion capture]] tracking suit could not be employed, so instead the effects team used both gray and chrome balls and a jumpsuit covered in mirrors—which also served as a lighting reference.&lt;ref name=ext/&gt;&lt;ref name=fxguide&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/making-mutants-for-x-men-first-class/|title=Making Mutants for ''X-Men: First Class'' | first = Ian | last = Failes|date=June 16, 2011 | accessdate=October 29, 2011 | publisher=[[fxguide]].com | archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/63YscEzx6?url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/making-mutants-for-x-men-first-class/ |archivedate=November 29, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Angel's digital wings, the animators studied slow-motion footage of dragonflies to create the wing pattern in a realistic way,&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt; and the designers added [[iridescence]] to &quot;make the wings prettier&quot;.&lt;ref name=atom6&gt;{{cite video|title=&quot;''Children of the Atom: Filming ''X-Men First Class&quot;|format=Featurette|publisher=20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|location=''X-Men: First Class'' Blu-Ray|trans-title=Pulling Off the Impossible}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visual of Banshee's screams was done through a digital ring-like structure based on renderings of sound waves such as [[Schlieren photography]].&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt;&lt;ref name=fxguide/&gt; The visual for Havok's blasts employed similar rings,&lt;ref name=fxguide/&gt; concentrated in beams or rings of light which were then [[Match moving|match moved]] into Till's mimed throwing.&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt; For Banshee's flight, the visual effects team used digital doubles only for distant shots, with closer ones employing Jones shot in a special flight rig.&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt; Azazel's teleporting was made to resemble the &quot;inky smoky effects&quot; used with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], who appeared in ''X2'' and is Azazel's son in the comics.&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt; However, while Nightcrawler only left a smoke trail, the visual effects team had Azazel accompanied by digital fire and smoke &quot;because he was more closely aligned with the devil&quot;. The fire was also used &quot;as a mask to hide or reveal the body&quot;, according to effects supervisor Matt Johnson.&lt;ref name=fxguide/&gt; Since the visible part of whirlwinds are the dust and dirt sucked up by them, the ones Riptide produces were made to resemble &quot;a tornado of gas, made out of nothingness&quot; by visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi. The final product was mostly a practical effect made with [[dry ice]], which was augmented by [[computer-generated imagery]].&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt; The visual effects team portrayed Mystique's abilities slightly differently due to this being a younger version, with &quot;the scales being slightly longer and the transformation being slightly showier than when she became the more mature Rebecca.&quot;&lt;ref name=awn/&gt; For Beast, computer graphics depicted his simian-like feet, the transformation sequence, and a few facial replacements for when Beast opened his mouth wider than the mask on Hoult's face allowed.&lt;ref name=cinefex/&gt;

==Music==
[[Henry Jackman]], who had worked with Vaughn in ''[[Kick-Ass (film)|Kick-Ass]]'', composed the score. Following the ''James Bond'' influences on ''First Class'', Jackman drew inspiration from [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]]'s work in the said series, which he described as &quot;extremely posh pop music&quot;.&lt;ref name=atom7&gt;{{cite video|title=&quot;''Children of the Atom: Filming'' X-Men: First Class&quot;|format=Featurette|publisher=20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|location=''X-Men: First Class'' Blu-Ray|trans-title=Sound and Fury}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackman started his work with a &quot;''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''-style theme&quot;, which is only featured in the final parts of the film as Vaughn thought it was too &quot;successful and triumphant&quot; for a disjointed and up-and-coming team. Therefore, Vaughn reworked a 'stretched' [[Half-time (music)|half-time]] version of the theme into the remainder of the film. The themes for Magneto and Shaw have similarities to reflect their &quot;perverted father-son&quot; relationship, with even a seamless transition during the scene where Shaw is killed to represent Lensherr's full transformation into Magneto.&lt;ref name=fmmg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicmag.com/?p=8019|title=Audio: On The Score With Henry Jackman|first=Daniel|last=Schweiger|date=June 6, 2011|publisher=Film Music Magazine|accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track &quot;Rage and Serenity&quot; is reused in Vaughn's 2017 film ''[[Kingsman: The Golden Circle]]''.

In a roundtable interview with multiple news outlets, Vaughn responded to a question about choosing &quot;[[Love Love (Take That song)|Love Love]]&quot; by the British band [[Take That]] for the end-credits theme, explaining, &quot;I bumped into [the band's lead singer] [[Gary Barlow|Gary &lt;nowiki&gt;[Barlow]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] in [Los Angeles], and we were just talking, and I said, 'Do you want to come and see a rough cut of it?' And they came, and they wrote the song, and I listened to it, and I said, 'I think it'll be a hit', and if we can do a video which gets girls more interested ... we might get them to come and watch it. So it's pure commerce, to be blunt, and I want women to see this film.&quot;&lt;ref name=geek&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/james-bond/17507/matthew-vaughn-interview-x-men-first-class-thor-hollywood-james-bond-take-that-and-more |title=Matthew Vaughn interview: X-Men: First Class, Thor, Hollywood, James Bond, Take That and more | date=May 25, 2011 |first= Michael| last= Leader|publisher=Den of Geek ([[Dennis Publishing]])|location= [[UK]] | accessdate=June 10, 2012 | archivedate=July 1, 2012| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68q12ykNM?url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/james-bond/17507/matthew-vaughn-interview-x-men-first-class-thor-hollywood-james-bond-take-that-and-more | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- If anyone has copies of the US and the UK DVD releases to check if the song actually appears in one version or the other, please add that information here --&gt; An instrumental of the song &quot;[[Run (I'm a Natural Disaster)]]&quot; by [[Gnarls Barkley]] is used in the 'mutant recruitment' scene.

Among the major trade publications, Todd McCarthy of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' described the film as &quot;audacious, confident and fueled by youthful energy&quot;, and said that &quot;director Vaughn impressively maintains a strong focus dedicated to clarity and dramatic power ... and orchestrates the mayhem with a laudable coherence, a task made easier by a charging, churning score by Henry Jackman ...&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCarthy&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/x-men-first-class-movie-192965 |title=X-Men: First Class: Movie Review | publisher=[[Nielsen Company]] | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=May 30, 2011 | accessdate=June 5, 2012 | author=McCarthy, Tod|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z6UDZnyi?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/x-men-first-class-movie-192965 |archivedate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said the film &quot;feels swift, sleek and remarkably coherent&quot;, and that &quot;the visual effects designed by John Dykstra are smoothly and imaginatively integrated ...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Variety&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/2011/film/reviews/x-men-first-class-1117945347/ | title=Review: X-Men: First Class | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=May 29, 2011 | accessdate=May 31, 2011 | author=Chang, Justin}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Lovece]] of ''[[Film Journal International]]'' lauded &quot;a wickedly smart script with a multilayered theme that ... never loses sight of its ultimate story, and makes each emotional motivation interlock, often shockingly playing for keeps with its characters.

In consumer publications, [[Lisa Schwarzbaum]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised &quot;the kind of youthful, Brit-knockabout pop energy director Matthew Vaughn absorbed from his previous collaborations as producer of director [[Guy Ritchie]]'s bloke-y larks&quot;, and found McAvoy and Fassbender &quot;a casting triumph.
