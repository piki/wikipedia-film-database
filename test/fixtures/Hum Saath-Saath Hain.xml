==Plot==
The plot revolves around the Chaturvedi Family, the father, Ramkishan Chaturvedi, a rich businessman, and his wife Mamta Chaturvedi. Ramkishan has 4 children: Vivek, Prem, Vinod and Sangeeta. The first half explores the love lives of each of the three sons : Vivek with Sadhna, the daughter of his father's business associate, Prem with Preeti, the daughter of a family friend and Vinod with Sapna.

Mamta's 3 best friends along with Sapna's father, fill her head with thoughts as to why Vivek should not be in charge of the family inheritance, as he is the stepson and not Mamta's real son. This causes Mamta to feel scared about what will happen.

The story takes a bitter turn when Sangita's brother-in-law cheats her husband, Anand from the inheritance and his share in the family business. This makes Mamta very paranoid and makes her question her husband's decision to make Vivek, her step son, the head of their family business. She demands that Ramkishan divide the business equally between all the sons instead of putting Vivek in charge. Ramkishan refuses because he thinks this will divide the family. Vivek is heartbroken when he finds out but decides to defuse the situation by telling his mother that he will move back to their ancestral village Rampur to take care of the new factory that they had recently set up there. In his place he asks his father to put Prem in charge of the family empire. His wife, Sadhna supports his decision. Vivek and Sadhna move to Rampur along with Vinod. Prem flat out refuses to replace his brother as the head of the family. But Vivek convinces him to go along with the plan in the interest of preventing further conflict within the family.

Sangita's brother-in-law eventually realizes that he made a huge mistake in cheating his brother and breaking up his family. This makes Mamta realize her mistake too and she reunites with Vivek. In the end, Sadhna gives birth to a baby boy and the other two couples are finally married.
