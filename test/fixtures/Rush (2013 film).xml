== Plot ==
[[James Hunt]] and [[Niki Lauda]] are exceptional racing car drivers who first develop a fierce rivalry in 1970 at a [[British Formula 3 International Series|Formula Three]] race in [[London]], when both their cars spin before Hunt wins the race. Hunt is a brash and self-confident individual, while Lauda is a cool and calculating technical genius who relies on practice and precision. Lauda takes a large bank loan from Austria’s [[Raiffeisen Bank International|Raiffeisen Bank]] (wearing their logo thereafter) to buy his way into the [[British Racing Motors|BRM]] [[Formula One]] team, meeting teammate [[Clay Regazzoni]] for the first time. Meanwhile, [[Hesketh Racing]], the fledgling racing team Hunt drives for, enters Formula One. Lauda then joins [[Scuderia Ferrari]] with Regazzoni and wins his first championship in [[1975 Formula One season|1975]]. Hesketh closes down after failing to secure a sponsor, but Hunt joins the [[McLaren]] team. During this time, Hunt marries supermodel [[Suzy Miller]], while Lauda develops a relationship with German socialite Marlene Knaus.

The [[1976 Formula One season|1976 season]] starts with Lauda dominating the first two races while Hunt struggles to catch up. Hunt wins the [[1976 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]], but is disqualified after a post-race inspection rules that his car is fractionally too wide. Struggling to comply with F1 rules, McLaren suffers a series of racing setbacks, and Hunt's situation is further exacerbated when Suzy starts a relationship with actor [[Richard Burton]]. Following his divorce, Hunt regains his competitive spirit and, when his disqualification in Spain is overturned, the points put him into championship contention. Lauda marries Marlene in a private ceremony but begins to have concerns about the effects of his newfound happiness, worrying that he has become vulnerable as a racer, as he now has something to lose.

At the [[1976 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]], Lauda urges the F1 committee to cancel the race due to heavy rain on the already notoriously dangerous [[Nürburgring|Nürburgring Nordschleife]]. At a drivers' meeting on race day, Hunt argues that Lauda is trying to benefit by having one less race in the season, and the drivers vote to race. Most drivers start the race with wet weather tyres, which becomes a costly tactic due to most of the track quickly drying. They all change tyres during the second lap, but on the third lap, a suspension arm in Lauda's Ferrari breaks, sending the car flying into an embankment then bursting into flames. Lauda is airlifted to hospital with third-degree burns to his head and face and internal burns to his lungs. For six weeks, Lauda is treated for his injuries while he watches Hunt dominate the races in his absence. Despite his doctor's orders, he decides to return to drive his Ferrari at the [[1976 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]], finishing fourth while Hunt fails to finish.

The 1976 season comes to a climax at the rain-soaked [[1976 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]]. Hunt's late rally in Lauda's absence has pulled him within three points of Lauda. At the end of the second lap, after his car has slid several times, Lauda returns to the pits and decides to retire from the race, considering it far too dangerous and opting to stay with Marlene instead. This gives Hunt a chance to win the championship if he can finish third or better. After facing stiff competition under gruelling conditions, tyre problems and a hand injury due to the gear shifter knob breaking, Hunt finishes third, winning the championship by a single point.

Hunt spends the rest of the year revelling with fame, sex and drugs, while Lauda takes an interest in flying private planes. At a private airfield in [[Bologna]], Lauda suggests to Hunt that he focus on the next racing season to defend his title, but Hunt argues that his glamorous lifestyle is the most enjoyable part of being world champion. Lauda later on realises that Hunt no longer feels he needs to prove himself to anyone. Hunt continues to race until his retirement in 1979, and becomes a motorsport broadcast commentator until his death in 1993 at the age of 45. Lauda reflects on how their great rivalry and personality differences spurred each other on to their finest achievements, and states that Hunt was the only other driver he ever envied.

Hunt and Lauda appear as themselves, in the 1970s and 1980s, in [[archive footage]] at the end of the film, while Lauda is then seen for a few seconds in contemporary (2013) footage.

==Production==
The film was shot on location in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]] and [[Austria]].&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web |title=Rush - Official Movie Site - 2013 |url=http://www.rushmovie.com/ |accessdate=June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blackbushe Airport]] in [[Hampshire]], the [[Snetterton Motor Racing Circuit|Snetterton]] ([[Norfolk]]), [[Cadwell Park]] ([[Lincolnshire]]), the former [[Crystal Palace circuit|Crystal Palace]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmlondon.org.uk/what-we-do/news/location_of_the_month_2013/september2013|title=Film London|work=filmlondon.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brands Hatch]] ([[Kent]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/2013/09/rush-2013/|title=Kent Film Office Rush Film Focus}}&lt;/ref&gt; motor racing circuits in Britain, and at the [[Nürburgring]] in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.horncastlenews.co.uk/community/people/hollywood-director-gets-a-real-rush-filming-at-cadwell-1-3833649|title=Hollywood director gets a real Rush filming at Cadwell|newspaper=Horncastle News|publisher=Johnston Publishing|date=May 11, 2012|accessdate=May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both vintage racing cars and replicas were used in the filming.

The financiers include [[Hürth]]-based action concept Film- und Stuntproduktion, Egoli Tossell Film, Revolution Films (GB) and [[Cross Creek Pictures]] (US). The Film- und Medienstiftung [[North Rhine-Westphalia|NRW]] funded the film with €1.35 million, additional funding was provided by MFG Filmförderung [[Baden-Württemberg]] and the German Federal Film Fund (DFFF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.filmstiftung.de/press/news-archive/premiere-on-saturday-in-cologne-rush/ |title=Premiere on Saturday in Cologne: &quot;Rush&quot; |publisher=Film und Media Stiftung NRW |date=2013-09-30 |accessdate=2013-12-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017211150/http://en.filmstiftung.de/press/news-archive/premiere-on-saturday-in-cologne-rush/ |archive-date=2013-10-17 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Director Ron Howard originally intended for [[Russell Crowe]] to make a cameo appearance as [[Richard Burton]] for a brief scene where he confronts James Hunt on his affair with Suzy.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryvsHollywood&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/rush.php |title=''Rush'' True Story vs. Movie |publisher=''History vs. Hollywood |accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.deadline.com/2011/10/olivia-wilde-lands-rush-role-of-suzy-miller-russell-crowe-for-richard-burton-cameo/ |title=Olivia Wilde Lands 'Rush' Role Of Suzy Miller; Russell Crowe For Richard Burton Cameo? |author=Fleming, Mike Jr. |magazine=Deadline |date=2011-10-04 |accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical accuracy==
Some things in the film are exaggerated (like the [[Hunt–Lauda rivalry]]; in reality they had shared a flat early in their careers and were good friends), others downplayed (like Lauda's wife's shock at his disfigurement), and others invented (like Hunt beating up a reporter or the [[Nürburgring]] nickname being &quot;the graveyard&quot;; in fact [[Jackie Stewart]] had nicknamed it &quot;the Green Hell&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/sep/18/rush-ron-howard-reel-history |title=Rush: a thrilling but untrusty ride |last1=von Tunzelmann |first1=Alex |date=18 September 2013 |website=www.theguardian.com |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.empireonline.com/features/rush-true-false |title=Rush Vs.

Other inaccuracies include the British F3 battle at [[Crystal Palace circuit|Crystal Palace]], which in reality was between Hunt and [[Dave Morgan (racing driver)|Dave Morgan]], and Hunt's overtake on Regazzoni for 3rd place in the Japanese Grand Prix when in the actual race he passed [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]]. Another error in the Japanese Grand Prix is that Regazzoni and [[Jacques Laffite|Laffite]] finished fourth and fifth, while in the actual race it was Jones and Regazzoni who finished fourth and fifth. In the end scene an incident is described where Hunt, while being a tv broadcaster, comes to a meet-up with Lauda on a bicycle with a flat tire. In reality this incident happened while Hunt ran out of money and fell into alcohol-addiction. On this day Lauda gave him money to rebuild his life. Hunt, after Lauda gave him money a second time, later fixed his life and got his job as a television broadcaster.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bensinger&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grahambensinger.com/index.php/episode-guide-2/episode-archive-2/niki-lauda/ |title=Niki Lauda |authorlink=Graham Bensinger |first=Graham |last=Bensinger |website=[[In Depth with Graham Bensinger]] |accessdate=26 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visual blog ''[[David McCandless|Information is Beautiful]]'' deduced that, while taking creative licence into account, the film was 82.9% accurate when compared to real-life events, summarizing that there were &quot;a little staging to get Lauda and Hunt in the same locations sometimes, but otherwise [it was] true&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Based on a True True Story?

==Reception==
===Box office===
''Rush'' was a box office success. It earned $26.9 million in domestic box office and $71.3 million in international box office for a worldwide gross of $98.2 million against a budget of $38 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;box office&quot;/&gt;

===Critical reception===
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 223 reviews with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website’s critical consensus reads, &quot;A sleek, slick, well-oiled machine, ''Rush'' is a finely crafted sports drama with exhilarating race sequences and strong performances from Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rottentomatoes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rush_2013/ | title=Rush (2013) | publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]] | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another review aggregator, [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Normalization (statistics)|normalised]] rating to reviews, calculated an average score of 75 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/rush | title=Rush Reviews | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | work=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Niki Lauda was pleased with the overall look of the film. He was quoted as saying: &quot;When I saw it the first time I was impressed. There was no Hollywood changes or things changed a little bit Hollywood-like. It is very accurate. And this really surprised me very positively.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryvsHollywood&quot;/&gt; Though, when first seeing the pre-screening of the unedited footage he considered himself to be portrayed too negatively. This changed on the day of the first screening when [[Bernie Ecclestone]] told him how much he liked it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bensinger&quot;/&gt;

===Home media===
''Rush'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] on 28 January 2014. A [[Sainsbury's]] exclusive edition with a bonus disc of new special features was released for a limited time. The Australian Blu-ray release is bundled with the 2013 documentary ''[[1 (2013 film)|1]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Rush-and-1-Double-Pack-Blu-ray/118307/ |title=Rush / 1: Double Pack Blu-ray |publisher=Blu-ray.com |accessdate=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
