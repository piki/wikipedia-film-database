==Plot==
In 1973 , Maharani Gitanjali ([[Ileana D'Cruz]]) is a princess to a royal family in Rajasthan. As every royal family has loads of gold to themselves, so does this royal family, but her ancestors did not hand it over to the government of the country even after the ancestral reign was over. In 1975, the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi declared the state of emergency in the country. Around the same time, Sanjeev ([[Priyanshu Chatterjee]]), an influential person in the Congress government, had been snubbed badly by Gitanjali in 1973 .To seek revenge, Sanjeev asks army officer Colonel Rudra Pratap Singh ([[Denzil Smith]]) to confiscate all the gold in Gitanjali’s possession and to put her behind bars. Rudra follows Sanjeev’s instructions and imprisons Gitanjali after forcibly taking possession of the gold rightfully belonging to the government but still held by her.
 
Rudra asks his trusted lieutenants, Major Seher Singh ([[Vidyut Jammwal]]) and Captain Somesh to transfer all the gold to Delhi safely to the government and for that, he gives Seher Singh a custom-made truck with a powerful safe in it, in which he keeps all the confiscated gold. As Rudra and Seher Singh are discussing, Sanjana ([[Esha Gupta]]), Gitanjali’s trusted aide, is sent by her to eavesdrop their conversation and get a whiff of their plan. Gitanjali then plans an entire scheme and wants Sanjana to accompany Bhawani Singh ([[Ajay Devgn]]) in getting all the gold back and eventually release her from the jail.
 
Gitanjali briefs Bhawani Singh, her trusted lieutenant, about the gold and how she needs it all back to look after the people in her village. The loyal Bhawani Singh promises to retrieve the gold and return the same to Gitanjali with whom he shares a romantic relationship.
 
Bhawani Singh with the support of Daliya ([[Emraan Hashmi]]) and Guruji ([[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]]), besides Sanjana, of course, chalk out an entire plan and seek out on a mission.  The four follow the truck in which Seher Singh and his deputy, Somesh (Arjun Dwivedi), are carrying the gold to the Delhi. The group of four, at one point in the journey, takes control of the truck after throwing out Seher Singh and Somesh. The job now is to open the strong safe, something at which Guruji is adept. Meanwhile, Seher Singh, boss Rudra Pratap Singh and other army and police officers are hot on the trail of Bhawani Singh and the truck. At one point, the army officers seek the help of police officer Durjan (Sharad Kelkar) but Bhawani Singh and his team members outwit him too.
 
But before Bhawani Singh can return the gold to Gitanjali Devi, a very shocking revelation is unveiled in front of him, that Gitanjali used him for her personal pleasure and motives, and that Seher was her aide. Bhawani reveals that he already knew dark truth about Gitanjali and his team decided to distribute gold among poor people. After the war between Seher and Bhawani’s team ends, Gitanjali realised that she is alone in the desert with a low chance of survival while Bhawani and his team have escaped.
