{{nihongo|'''''My Neighbor Totoro'''''|となりのトトロ|Tonari no Totoro|lead=yes}} is a 1988 Japanese [[anime|animated]] [[fantasy film]] written and directed by [[Hayao Miyazaki]] and animated by [[Studio Ghibli]] for [[Tokuma Shoten]]. The film—which stars the voice actors [[Noriko Hidaka]], [[Chika Sakamoto]], and [[Hitoshi Takagi]]—tells the story of the two young daughters (Satsuki and Mei) of a professor and their interactions with friendly wood spirits in [[postwar Japan|postwar rural Japan]]. The film won the [[Animage]] Anime Grand Prix prize and the [[Mainichi Film Award]] and [[Kinema Junpo Awards|Kinema Junpo Award]] for Best Film in 1988. It also received the Special Award at the [[Blue Ribbon Awards]] in the same year.

In 1989, [[Streamline Pictures]] produced an exclusive [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] for use on transpacific flights by [[Japan Airlines]]. [[Troma Entertainment|Troma Films]], under their 50th St. Films banner, distributed the dub of the film co-produced by [[Jerry Beck]]. This dub was released to United States theaters in 1993, on VHS and laserdisc in the United States by [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|Fox Video]] in 1994, and on DVD in 2002. The rights to this dub expired in 2004, so it was re-released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] on 7 March 2006&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tiff.net/films/my-neighbor-totoro/|title=My Neighbor Totoro|website=TIFF|language=en|access-date=2017-07-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170605131311/http://www.tiff.net/films/my-neighbor-totoro/|archivedate=2017-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a new dub cast.

This DVD release is the first version of the film in the United States to include both Japanese and English language tracks, as Fox did not have the rights to the Japanese audio track for their version.

''My Neighbor Totoro'' was critically acclaimed and has amassed a worldwide [[cult following]] in the years after its release. The film and its titular character, Totoro, have become cultural icons. While the film only grossed {{US$|6.1 million|long=no}} at the box office, it went to gross approximately {{US$|266 million|long=no}} from [[home video]] sales and at least {{US$|1.142 billion|long=no}} from licensed [[merchandise]] sales, adding up to at least {{US$|1.414 billion|long=no}} in total revenue, as of 2018.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. --&gt;
In [[1958 in Japan|1958 Japan]], university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe and his two daughters, Satsuki and Mei, move into an old house to be closer to the hospital where the girls' mother, Yasuko, is recovering from a long-term illness. Satsuki and Mei find that the house is inhabited by tiny creatures called ''[[susuwatari]]''—small, dark, dust-like house spirits seen when moving from light to dark places.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The susuwatari are called &quot;black soots&quot; in early subtitles and &quot;soot sprites&quot; in the later English dubbed version.&lt;/ref&gt; When the girls become comfortable in their new house and laugh with Tatsuo, the soot spirits leave the house to drift away on the wind and find another empty house.

One day, Mei sees two white, rabbit-like ears in the grass and follows the ears under the house. She discovers two small spirits who lead her through a briar patch and into the hollow of a large [[Cinnamomum camphora|camphor tree]]. She meets and befriends a larger version of the same kind of spirit, which identifies itself by a series of roars that she interprets as &quot;Totoro&quot;. She falls asleep atop the large totoro, but when Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground in a dense briar clearing. Despite her many attempts, Mei is unable to show her family Totoro's tree. Tatsuo comforts her by telling her that this is the &quot;keeper of the forest,&quot; and that Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to.{{Multiple image|align = right|image1 = Expo 2005 of Satsuki and Mei’s House 01.jpg|caption1 = Satsuki and Mei's house ([[:ja:サツキとメイの家]]) at the [[Expo 2005]] site.|image2 = Satsuki and Mei's House 01.JPG|caption2 = Closeup view of Satsuki and Mei's house|direction = vertical}}

One rainy night, the girls are waiting for Tatsuo's bus and grow worried when he doesn't arrive on the bus they expect him on. As they wait, Mei eventually falls asleep on Satsuki's back and Totoro appears beside them, allowing Satsuki to see him for the first time. He has only a leaf on his head for protection against the rain, so Satsuki offers him the umbrella she had taken along for her father. Totoro is delighted at both the shelter and the sounds made upon it by falling raindrops. In return, he gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds. A [[catbus|giant, bus-shaped cat]] halts at the stop, and Totoro boards it, taking the umbrella. Shortly after, Tatsuo's bus arrives.

The girls plant the seeds. A few days later, they awaken at midnight to find Totoro and his two miniature colleagues engaged in a [[ceremonial dance]] around the planted nuts and seeds. The girls join in, whereupon the seeds sprout, and then grow and combine into an enormous tree. Totoro takes his colleagues and the girls for a ride on a magical flying [[top]]. In the morning, the tree is gone, but the seeds have indeed sprouted; it is left unclear whether or not the girls were dreaming.

The girls find out that a planned visit by Yasuko has to be postponed because of a setback in her treatment. Satsuki, disappointed and worried, tells Mei the bad news, which Mei does not take well. This leads to an argument between the two, ending in Satsuki yelling at Mei and stomping off. Mei decides to walk to the hospital to bring some fresh corn to Yasuko.

Mei's disappearance prompts Satsuki and the neighbors to search for her. Eventually, Satsuki returns in desperation to the [[Cinnamomum camphora|camphor tree]] and pleads for Totoro's help. Delighted to be of assistance, he summons the Catbus, which carries her to where the lost Mei sits. Having rescued her, the Catbus then whisks her and Satsuki over the countryside to see Yasuko in the hospital. The girls perch in a tree outside of the hospital, overhearing a conversation between their parents and discovering that she has been kept in hospital by a minor cold, but is otherwise doing well. They secretly leave the ear of corn on the windowsill, where it is discovered by the parents, and return home on the Catbus.

Eventually, Mei and Satsuki's mother returns home, and the sisters play with other children, while Totoro and his friends watch them from afar.

==Production==
[[Art director]] [[Kazuo Oga]] was drawn to the film when Hayao Miyazaki showed him an original image of Totoro standing in a [[satoyama]]. The director challenged Oga to raise his standards, and Oga's experience with ''My Neighbor Totoro'' jump-started the artist's career. Oga and Miyazaki debated the palette of the film, Oga seeking to paint black soil from [[Akita Prefecture]] and Miyazaki preferring the color of red soil from the [[Kantō region]].&lt;ref name=art /&gt;{{rp|82}} The ultimate product was described by [[Studio Ghibli]] producer Toshio Suzuki: &quot;It was nature painted with translucent colors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Yoshiaki | last=Kikuchi | title=Totoro's set decorator | work=Daily Yomiuri | date=2007-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oga's conscientious approach to ''My Neighbor Totoro'' was a style that the ''International Herald Tribune'' recognized as &quot;[updating] the traditional Japanese animist sense of a natural world that is fully, spiritually alive&quot;. The newspaper described the final product:
{{quote|Set in a period that is both modern and nostalgic, the film creates a fantastic, yet strangely believable universe of supernatural creatures coexisting with modernity. A great part of this sense comes from Oga's evocative backgrounds, which give each tree, hedge and twist in the road an indefinable feeling of warmth that seems ready to spring into sentient life.&lt;ref name=paper /&gt;}}
Oga's work on ''My Neighbor Totoro'' led to his continued involvement with Studio Ghibli. The studio assigned jobs to Oga that would play to his strengths, and Oga's style became a trademark style of Studio Ghibli.&lt;ref name=paper&gt;{{cite news | title=When Studio Ghibli is mentioned, usually the name of its co-founder and chief director Hayao Miyazaki springs to mind. But anyone with an awareness of the labor-intensive animation process knows that such masterpieces as ''Tonari no Totoro''... | work=International Herald Tribune-Asahi Shimbun | date=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several of Miyazaki's initial conceptual [[Watercolor painting|watercolors]], as well as on the theatrical release poster and on later home video releases, only one young girl is depicted, rather than two sisters. According to Miyazaki, &quot;If she was a little girl who plays around in the yard, she wouldn't be meeting her father at a bus stop, so we had to come up with two girls instead. And that was difficult.&quot;&lt;ref name=art /&gt; The opening sequence of the film was not storyboarded, Miyazaki said. &quot;The sequence was determined through permutations and combinations determined by the time sheets. Each element was made individually and combined in the time sheets...&quot;&lt;ref name=art&gt;{{cite book | first=Nobuhiro | last=Watsuki | title=The Art of My Neighbor Totoro: A Film by Hayao Miyazaki | year=2005 | publisher=VIZ Media LLC | isbn=978-1591166986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}} The ending sequence depicts the mother's return home and the signs of her return to good health by playing with Satsuki and Mei outside.&lt;ref name=art /&gt;{{rp|149}}

The storyboard depicts the town of Matsuko as the setting, with the year being 1955; Miyazaki stated that it was not exact and the team worked on a setting &quot;in the recent past&quot;.&lt;ref name=art /&gt;{{rp|33}} The film was originally set to be an hour long, but throughout the process it grew to respond to the social context including the reason for the move and the father's occupation.&lt;ref name=&quot;art&quot; /&gt;{{rp|54}}

Miyazaki has said that Totoro is &quot;not a spirit: he's only an animal. I believe he lives on acorns. He's supposedly the forest keeper, but that's only a half-baked idea, a rough approximation.&quot;&lt;ref name=art /&gt;{{rp|103}} The character of Mei was modeled on Miyazaki's niece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-10-18/toy-story-3-art-director-married-to-hayao-miyazaki-niece |title=Toy Story 3 Art Director Married to Hayao Miyazaki's Niece – Interest |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2011-10-18 |accessdate=2012-08-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122083202/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-10-18/toy-story-3-art-director-married-to-hayao-miyazaki-niece |archivedate=2012-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
After writing and filming ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind]]'' (1984) and ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'' (1986), Hayao Miyazaki began directing ''My Neighbor Totoro'' for [[Studio Ghibli]]. Miyazaki's production paralleled his colleague [[Isao Takahata]]'s production of ''[[Grave of the Fireflies]]''. Miyazaki's film was financed by executive producer Yasuyoshi Tokuma, and both ''My Neighbor Totoro'' and ''Grave of the Fireflies'' were released on the same bill in 1988. The dual billing was considered &quot;one of the most moving and remarkable double bills ever offered to a cinema audience&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mccarthy&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Helen | last=McCarthy | title=Hayao Miyazaki: Master of Japanese Animation | publisher=Stone Bridge Press | year=1999 | isbn=1-880656-41-8 | pages=43,120–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, ''My Neighbor Totoro'' and ''Grave of the Fireflies'' grossed {{US$|5 million|long=no}} at the box office.&lt;ref name=&quot;jpninfo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 7 Studio Ghibli Films of All Time|url=http://jpninfo.com/14771|website=Japan Info|date=July 14, 2015|access-date=2018-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303040510/http://jpninfo.com/14771|archive-date=2018-03-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 European release of ''My Neighbor Totoro'' grossed {{US$|1.1 million|long=no}} at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tonari no Totoro (My Neighbor Totoro) (2002) |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/intl/?page=&amp;id=_fTONARINOTOTORO(R01 |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined, the film's box office gross was {{US$|{{#expr:5+1.1}} million|long=no}} in Japan and Europe.

===Home video===
In 1993, [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|Fox Video]] released the Streamline Pictures dub of ''My Neighbor Totoro'' on [[VHS]] and [[Laserdisc]]. However, because of his disappointment with the result of the heavily edited English version of ''Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind'', Miyazaki would not permit any part of the movie to be edited out, all the names had to remain the same (with the exception being Catbus), the translation had to be as close to the original Japanese as possible, and no part of the movie could be changed for any reason, cultural or linguistic (which was very common at the time) despite creating problems with some English viewers, particularly in explaining the origin of the name &quot;Totoro&quot;. It was produced by [[John Daly (producer)|John Daly]] and Derek Gibson, with co-producer [[Jerry Beck]]. [[20th Century Fox]] held all rights to the Streamline Pictures dub of the film until their rights to the dub expired in 2004. Disney's English-language dub premiered on 23 October 2005; it then appeared at the 2005 Hollywood Film Festival. The [[Turner Classic Movies]] cable television network held the television premiere of Disney's new English dub on 19 January 2006, as part of the network's salute to Hayao Miyazaki. (TCM aired the dub as well as the original Japanese with English subtitles.) The Disney version was initially released on [[DVD]] on 7 March 2006, but is now out of print. This version was also released by [[Madman Entertainment]] in Australia, and [[StudioCanal UK|Optimum Releasing]] in the United Kingdom. A reissue of ''Totoro'', ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'', and ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]'' featuring updated cover art highlighting its Studio Ghibli origins was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on 2 March 2010, coinciding with the US DVD and Blu-ray debut of ''[[Ponyo]]''. It was later released on [[Blu-ray|Blu-Ray Disc]]. [[GKIDS]] re-issued the film on Blu-ray &amp; DVD on October 17, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/gkids-studio-ghibli-ink-home-entertainment-deal-1021746|title=Gkids, Studio Ghibli Ink Home Entertainment Deal|author=Carolyn Giardina|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=17 July 2017|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As is the case with Disney's other English dubs of Miyazaki films, the Disney version of ''Totoro'' features a star-heavy cast, including [[Dakota Fanning|Dakota]] and [[Elle Fanning]] as Satsuki and Mei, [[Timothy Daly]] as Mr. Kusakabe, [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]] as Granny, [[Lea Salonga]] as Mrs. Kusakabe, and [[Frank Welker]] as Totoro and [[Catbus]]. The songs for the new dub retained the same translation as the previous dub, but were sung by [[Sonya Isaacs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=My Neighbor Totoro|url=http://movies.disney.com/my-neighbor-totoro|language=en|accessdate=2018-02-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206133629/http://movies.disney.com/my-neighbor-totoro|archive-date=2018-02-06|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The songs for the Fox version of ''Totoro'' were sung by Cassie Byram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=From ‘Mere’ to ‘Interesting’ [Cassie's Corner]|url=http://www.oodlesworld.com/blog/?p=2400|language=en|accessdate=2018-06-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622060242/http://www.oodlesworld.com/blog/?p=2400|archive-date=2018-06-22|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, the film sold 3.5{{nbsp}}million VHS and DVD units as of April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=「となりのトトロ」ついにブルーレイ発売 |url=http://movies.jp.msn.com/news/article.aspx?articleid=986774 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502072542/http://movies.jp.msn.com/news/article.aspx?articleid=986774 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 May 2012 |work=MSN エンタメ |publisher=[[MSN]] |date=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an average retail price of {{JPY|4600}} ({{JPY|4700}} on DVD and {{JPY|4500}} on VHS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=My Neighbor Totoro: Video List |url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/video/totoro/ |website=Nausicaa.net |accessdate=15 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180225145501/http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/video/totoro/ |archive-date=2018-02-25 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; this is equivalent to approximately {{JPY|{{#expr:3.5*4600}} million|long=no}} ({{US$|{{To USD|16100|JPN|year=2012|round=yes}} million|long=no}}) in Japanese sales revenue as of 2012.

==Reception==

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' identified ''My Neighbor Totoro'' as one of his &quot;Great Movies&quot;, calling it &quot;one of the lovingly hand-crafted works of Hayao Miyazaki&quot;. In his review, Ebert declared &quot;''My Neighbor Totoro'' is based on experience, situation and exploration—not on conflict and threat&quot;, and described its appeal:
{{quote|... it would never have won its worldwide audience just because of its warm heart. It is also rich with human comedy in the way it observes the two remarkably convincing, lifelike little girls.... It is a little sad, a little scary, a little surprising and a little informative, just like life itself. It depends on a situation instead of a plot, and suggests that the wonder of life and the resources of imagination supply all the adventure you need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Roger | last=Ebert | authorlink=Roger Ebert | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20011223/REVIEWS08/112230301/1023 | title=My Neighbor Totoro (1993) | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=2001-12-23 | accessdate=2008-09-30 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218221622/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20011223%2FREVIEWS08%2F112230301%2F1023 | archivedate=2009-02-18 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 1993 translation was not as well received as the 2006 translation. Leonard Klady of the entertainment trade newspaper ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote of the 1993 translation, that ''My Neighbor Totoro'' demonstrated &quot;adequate television technical craft&quot; that was characterized by &quot;muted pastels, homogenized pictorial style and [a] vapid storyline&quot;. Klady described the film's environment, &quot;Obviously aimed at an international audience, the film evinces a disorienting combination of cultures that produces a nowhere land more confused than fascinating.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Leonard | last=Klady | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117900788.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 | title=My Neighbor Totoro | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=1993-05-06 | accessdate=2008-09-30 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219235755/http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117900788.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 | archivedate=2009-02-19 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Holden of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the 1993 translation as &quot;very visually handsome&quot;, and believed that the film was &quot;very charming&quot; when &quot;dispensing enchantment&quot;. Despite the highlights, Holden wrote, &quot;Too much of the film, however, is taken up with stiff, mechanical chitchat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Stephen | last=Holden | title=Review/Film; Even a Beast Is Sweet as Can Be | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=1993-06-14 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F0CE7DC1430F937A25756C0A965958260 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226131704/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F0CE7DC1430F937A25756C0A965958260 | archivedate=2017-02-26 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew Leyland of ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' reviewed the DVD released in 2006, &quot;Miyazaki's family fable is remarkably light on tension, conflict and plot twists, yet it beguiles from beginning to end... what sticks with the viewer is the every-kid credibility of the girls' actions as they work, play and settle into their new surroundings.&quot; Leyland praised the DVD transfer of the film, but noted that the disc lacked a look at the film's production, instead being overabundant with storyboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Matthew | last=Leyland | title=My Neighbour Totoro |date=June 2006 | journal=[[Sight &amp; Sound]] | volume=16 | issue=6 | page=89 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''My Neighbor Totoro'' set its writer-director Hayao Miyazaki on the road to success. The film's central character, Totoro, is as famous among Japanese children as [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] is among British ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;defining&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Pilling | title=Defining Moment: ''My Neighbour Totoro'', 1988, directed by Hayao Miyazaki | work=[[Financial Times]] | date=2007-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'' recognized Totoro as one of the greatest cartoon characters, describing the creature, &quot;At once innocent and awe-inspiring, King Totoro captures the innocence and magic of childhood more than any of Miyazaki's other magical creations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Dee | last=Forbes | title=Analysis Cartoons: Toontown's greatest characters | work=[[The Independent]] | date=2005-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Financial Times]]'' recognized the character's appeal, &quot;[Totoro] is more genuinely loved than [[Mickey Mouse]] could hope to be in his wildest—not nearly so beautifully illustrated—fantasies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;defining&quot;/&gt; Totoro and characters from the movie play a significant role in the [[Ghibli Museum]], including a large [[catbus]] and the Straw Hat Cafe.

The environmental journal ''Ambio'' described the influence of ''My Neighbor Totoro'', &quot;[It] has served as a powerful force to focus the positive feelings that the Japanese people have for [[satoyama]] and traditional village life.&quot; The film's central character Totoro was used as a mascot by the Japanese &quot;Totoro Hometown Fund Campaign&quot; to preserve areas of [[satoyama]] in the [[Saitama Prefecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Hiromi | last=Kobori |author2=Richard B.

Totoro has made cameo appearances in multiple Studio Ghibli films, including ''[[Pom Poko]]'', ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]'', and ''[[Whisper of the Heart]]''.  Various other anime series and films have featured cameos, including one episode of the [[Gainax]] TV series ''[[Kare Kano|His and Her Circumstances]]''. Miyazaki uses Totoro as a part of his Studio Ghibli company logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

A main-belt asteroid, discovered on December 31, 1994, was named [[10160 Totoro]] after the film's central character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=10160+Totoro | title=10160 Totoro (1994 YQ1) | work=Solar System Dynamics | publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] | accessdate=2008-09-30 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510055624/http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=10160+Totoro | archivedate=2011-05-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 a [[Onychophora|velvet worm]] species ''[[Eoperipatus totoro]]'', recently discovered in [[Vietnam]], was named after Totoro: &quot;Following the request of Pavel V. Kvartalnov, Eduard A. Galoyan and Igor V. Palko, the species is named after the main character of the cartoon movie &quot;My Neighbour Totoro&quot; by Hayao Miyazaki (1988, Studio Ghibli), who uses a many-legged animal as a vehicle, which according to the collectors resembles a velvet worm.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044523113000028?via=ihub|title=A new species of Eoperipatus (Onychophora) from Vietnam reveals novel morphological characters for the South-East Asian Peripatidae|authors = I D S Oliveira, S Schaffer, P V Kvartalnov , E A Galoyan, I V Palko, A Weck-Heimann, P Geissler, H Ruhberg | doi=10.1016/j.jcz.2013.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Mei and the Kittenbus'''''|めいとこねこバス|''Mei to Konekobasu''}} is a thirteen-minute sequel to ''My Neighbor Totoro'', written and directed by Miyazaki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-06-20/miyazaki-plans-museum-anime-shorts-after-ponyo |title=Miyazaki Plans Museum Anime Shorts After Ponyo |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2008-06-20 |accessdate=2008-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001191955/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-06-20/miyazaki-plans-museum-anime-shorts-after-ponyo |archivedate=2008-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chika Sakamoto]], who voiced Mei in ''Totoro'', returned to voice Mei in this short. Hayao Miyazaki himself did the voice of the Granny Cat (''Neko Baa-chan''), as well as Totoro. It concentrates on the character of Mei Kusakabe from the original film and her adventures one night with the Kittenbus (the offspring of the [[Catbus]] from the film) and other cat-oriented vehicles.

Originally released in Japan in 2003, the short is regularly shown at the [[Ghibli Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ghibli-museum.jp/welcome/cinema/| title=三鷹の森 ジブリ美術館 – 映像展示室 土星座| accessdate=2008-04-08| publisher=| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228124413/http://www.ghibli-museum.jp/welcome/cinema/| archivedate=2008-02-28| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has not been released to home video.
