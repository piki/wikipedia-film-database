{{nihongo|'''''Lupin the Third: The Castle of Cagliostro'''''|ルパン三世 カリオストロの城|Rupan Sansei: Kariosutoro no Shiro|lead=yes}} is a 1979 Japanese [[Anime|animated]] [[action film|action]]-[[adventure film|adventure]] [[comedy film|comedy]] film co-written and directed by [[Hayao Miyazaki]] as his feature film debut. It is the second feature film featuring [[Monkey Punch]]'s master thief [[Arsène Lupin III]], from his [[manga]] series ''[[Lupin III]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;New York Times&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Maslin| first= Janet | authorlink= Janet Maslin| work= [[The New York Times]] |title=A Wolf, A Princess, A Castle In the Alps| date= 3 July 1992|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE7D9143AF930A35754C0A964958260|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was Miyazaki's first time directing a theatrical feature after having previously worked as an animator for [[Toei Animation]] and [[Telecom Animation Film]] and directing several television shows including ''[[Lupin the Third Part I|Lupin III]]'' and two episodes of ''[[Lupin III Part II]]''.

''The Castle of Cagliostro'' follows [[gentleman thief]] [[Arsène Lupin III]], who successfully robs a casino – only to find the money to be [[counterfeit]]. He heads to the tiny country of Cagliostro, the rumoured source of the bills, and attempts to save the runaway Clarisse from the Count Cagliostro's men. Lupin enlists his associates, Jigen and Goemon, and sends his calling card to the Count to get Inspector Zenigata, his longtime nemesis, to the castle. After becoming trapped in the dungeon under the castle, Lupin and Zenigata form a pact to escape and foil the Count's counterfeit operation and save Clarisse from her forced marriage to the Count.

The original theatrical release in Japan occurred on 15 December 1979. The American theatrical debut was on 3 April 1991, with the home release following in October 1992. This first dub was produced by [[Streamline Pictures]] and released on home video the following year. A new dubbed version was produced by [[Manga Entertainment]] in 2000 and has had several releases. Despite initially underperforming at the box office, ''The Castle of Cagliostro'' has garnered high praise, with critics and historians noting the film's influence on Miyazaki's later works, and has since become the most popular and well-regarded entry in the entire ''Lupin III'' franchise. However, some have disapproved of its depiction of Lupin as a gallant hero instead of his original persona as a ruthless criminal. The film has served as a major influence on animators and directors worldwide, most notably [[Pixar]] director [[John Lasseter]].

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! --&gt;
In September 1968, master thief [[Arsène Lupin III]] and his colleague, [[Daisuke Jigen]], flee the [[Monte Carlo Casino]] with huge quantities of stolen money. They escape in Lupin's [[Fiat 500]], but Lupin recognizes the bills as distinctively high-quality counterfeits.{{efn|In the Japanese dialogue, the counterfeit bills are called &quot;Gōto-satsu&quot; (ゴート札), which is written as &quot;Ghoto bills&quot; in the heavily-simplified TMS subtitled version. The Streamline dub, which used TMS' subtitles as a primary translation source, explains that &quot;Ghoto&quot; was the name of the person responsible for the creation of Cagliostro's counterfeiting ring. The Animaze/Manga dub interprets &quot;Gōto&quot; as a [[transliteration]] of [[goat]] - the Japanese word for which is &quot;yagi&quot; (ヤギ) - in part due to the abundant goat and ram-related imagery present in the film, and thus refers to the counterfeits as &quot;Goat bills&quot;. However, in the Japanese version, Lupin describes the writing on Clarisse's ring as being &quot;Gōto-moji&quot; (ゴート文字), or Gothic characters, which implies that the houses of Cagliostro are descended from the ancient [[Goths]]. The Animaze/Manga dub describes the writing as &quot;[[Capra (genus)|Capra]]n&quot;, furthering the film's symbolic use of goats. When preparing the English subtitles for [[Discotek Media]]'s DVD and Blu-ray, translators Shoko Oono and Reed Nelson chose to name the counterfeits &quot;Gothic bills&quot; instead of &quot;Goat bills&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DVD Commentary&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DVD Translation Notes&quot;&gt;{{cite video

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Deciding to seek out the source, they head to the [[Grand Duchy]] of Cagliostro, the alleged wellspring of the counterfeits.

Shortly after arriving, they rescue a young woman being pursued by a gang of thugs, with her and Lupin falling off a cliff while escaping. Lupin is knocked unconscious, and the woman captured, but she leaves him a signet ring. Lupin recognizes the woman as Clarisse, the princess of Cagliostro, who will soon be married to Count Cagliostro, the country's regent. The Count's [[arranged marriage]] will cement his power and recover the fabled ancient treasure of Cagliostro, for which he needs both his and Clarisse's ancestral rings.

A squad of assassins attack Lupin and Jigen at their inn but fail to kill them or  recover the ring. Lupin leaves his calling card on the back of Jodot, the Count's butler and chief assassin, announcing he is going to steal Clarisse. Lupin summons [[Goemon Ishikawa XIII]] to aid their quest to rescue the princess and tips off his longtime pursuer, Inspector [[Koichi Zenigata]], to his whereabouts to provide a distraction. Zenigata's presence and a party give Lupin enough time to sneak into the castle. There he finds his on-off lover, [[Fujiko Mine]], posing as Clarisse's lady-in-waiting, who tells him where the princess is being held. Lupin makes his way to Clarisse and returns her ring, vowing to help her to escape. Before he can act, the Count drops Lupin down a trapdoor into the castle's catacombs, as Lupin had planned. Lupin mocks the Count through the ring he gave to Clarisse – a fake containing a transmitter – and the Count sends three assassins to retrieve the real ring.

Lupin encounters Zenigata, who was accidentally dropped down earlier, and they form a pact to help each other escape. After overpowering the assassins, they escape into a room full of printing presses — the source of the counterfeits. Zenigata wants to collect evidence, but Lupin points out they must escape the castle first. They start a fire as a distraction and steal the Count's [[autogyro]]. However, as they attempt to rescue Clarisse, Lupin is shot. Clarisse offers the ring to the Count in exchange for Lupin's life.  After securing the ring, the Count's attempt at betrayal is foiled when Fujiko's actions allow her, Lupin, and Zenigata to flee. As Lupin recovers from his injuries, Zenigata attempts to convince his superiors at [[Interpol]] to prosecute the Count for counterfeiting, but fearing political repercussions, they halt the investigation and remove him from the case. Meanwhile, Lupin intends to stop the wedding and rescue the princess. He also reveals his reasons for rescuing Clarisse to Jigen, Goemon and her family's former gardener — as a young girl, she had saved his life during his unsuccessful first attempt to find the source of the counterfeit bills ten years earlier. Fujiko tips off Lupin on a way to sneak into the castle, and forms a plan with Zenigata to publicly reveal the counterfeiting operation under the cover of pursuing Lupin.

The wedding with a drugged Clarisse appears to go as planned, until Lupin disrupts the ceremony and, despite the Count's precautions, makes off with both Clarisse and the Count's rings. Meanwhile, Zenigata and his squadron arrive in the chaos, and the inspector leads Fujiko, posing as a television reporter, to the Count's counterfeiting facility to expose the operation to the world. The Count pursues Lupin and Clarisse to the face of the castle's clock tower. Lupin is forced to surrender the rings to save Clarisse, and they are both knocked into the lake surrounding the tower. After using the rings to reveal the secret of Cagliostro, the Count is killed by the mechanism unveiling the treasure. Lupin and Clarisse watch as the lake around the castle drains to reveal exquisite ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ruins — the true treasure of Cagliostro. Lupin and his friends bid farewell to Clarisse, now the rightful ruler of Cagliostro. With Zenigata pursuing them again (for the crime of &quot;stealing Clarisse's heart&quot;) and Fujiko fleeing with the [[printing plate|plates]] from counterfeit printing presses, Lupin and the gang drive out of Cagliostro, with the police close behind them.

==Production==
''[[Lupin III]]'' began as a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by [[Monkey Punch]]. The title character, [[Arsène Lupin III]], was inspired by (and is claimed in the series to be the grandson of) [[Maurice Leblanc]]'s fictional character [[Arsène Lupin]], a gallant and famous outlaw able to outsmart even [[Sherlock Holmes]].&lt;ref name=dc /&gt; Lupin III is a [[gentleman thief]] and announces his intentions to steal valuable objects by sending a calling card to the owners of the desired items. The manga's popularity led to two [[anime]] series, titled ''[[Lupin The Third Part I|Lupin III]]'' and ''[[Lupin III Part II]]''.&lt;ref name=dc /&gt; The first film, ''[[The Mystery of Mamo]]'', was released on 16 December 1978. ''Cagliostro'' followed the year later following the financial success of that film. This is marked as the first feature length film to be directed by Miyazaki, who had previously co-directed episodes of the first Lupin anime series with [[Isao Takahata]] and the two directors along with  [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]] will give birth to [[Studio Ghibli]] in 1985. He was also a writer and director of two episodes in the second series under the pseudonym &quot;Telecom&quot;, both produced a year after ''Cagliostro''.&lt;ref name=dc /&gt; In works other than ''Castle of Cagliostro'' and the series episodes directed by Miyazaki and Takahata, Lupin III is portrayed as a scheming and lecherous thief, sometimes supported by his former enemies Jigen and Goemon. Miyazaki's film conflicts with the typical behavior and personality of the characters, a change that has been described as Lupin &quot;growing up&quot;.&lt;ref name=dc /&gt;&lt;ref name=om /&gt;

''Castle of Cagliostro'' marked Miyazaki's debut as a theatrical movie director, but he also was a writer, a designer, and a storyboardist on the movie.&lt;ref name=&quot;om&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/SearchAudience/News1/The_Castle_of_Cagliostro_4553.aspx | title=The Castle of Cagliostro Hayao Miyazaki's First (And Most Enjoyable) Movie | publisher=Otaku USA Magazine | date=9 March 2012 | accessdate=27 August 2013 | author=Surat, Daryl | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018154933/http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/SearchAudience/News1/The_Castle_of_Cagliostro_4553.aspx | archive-date=18 October 2014 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The production for the film began in May 1979 with the writing of the story and storyboarding for the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;hm&quot; /&gt; Miyazaki began by drawing a bird's eye view of the setting before creating the story to completion. After the first draft scenario was returned to Miyazaki without change, he began the storyboards. The story was divided into four parts, but after reaching the third part changes had to be made at the storyboard phase in order to not exceed the decided running time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miyazaki |first=Hayao |title=Starting Point 1979~1996 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |isbn=978-1-4215-0594-7 |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animation work began in July while the storyboards were only a quarter complete; Miyazaki had to complete them during the animation production. Production wrapped up at the end of November and the film's premier on December 15, 1979 was a short seven and a half months from the project's undertaking, with only five months of production time.&lt;ref name=&quot;hm&quot; /&gt;

The film draws upon many sources of inspiration that were important in the production of the film. McCarthy writes that a research trip was not specifically undertaken for the film, but says Miyazaki's Heidi sketchbooks were useful for the scenery.&lt;ref name=&quot;hm&quot; /&gt; Miyazaki would cite ''Italian Mountain Cities and the Tiber Estuary'' from Kagoshima Publishing as influencing the production of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;hm&quot; /&gt; The film included elements that were seen in other [[Arsène Lupin]] works, including ''La Justice d'Arsène Lupin'' by [[Boileau-Narcejac]], involving the discovery of a tremendous stash of forged franc notes with which [[History of Germany during World War I|World War I–era Germany]] had planned to destabilize the French economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andre&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coolfrenchcomics.com/arsenelupintimeline.htm |title=Arsène Lupin – A Timeline |first=André-François |last=Ruaud |accessdate=30 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806032324/http://www.coolfrenchcomics.com/arsenelupintimeline.htm |archive-date=6 August 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurice Leblanc]]'s ''The Green-eyed Lady'' also featured a secret treasure hidden at the bottom of a lake.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_a&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/lupin/faq.html#true |title=FAQ // Lupin III // |publisher=Nausicaa.net |accessdate=8 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026202406/http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/lupin/faq.html#true |archive-date=26 October 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle is visually influenced by that of the original 1952 unfinished release of ''[[The King and the Bird|The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;av&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://animatedviews.com/2009/an-auteur-is-born-30-years-of-miyazakis-castle-of-cagliostro/ | title=An Auteur is Born – 30 Years Of Miyazaki’s Castle Of Cagliostro | publisher=Animatedviews | accessdate=16 July 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819194944/http://animatedviews.com/2009/an-auteur-is-born-30-years-of-miyazakis-castle-of-cagliostro/ | archive-date=19 August 2013 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg writes, &quot;''Cagliostro'' also borrowed many narrative and visual elements from Grimault's film: the basic plotline of disrupting the wedding of an evil tyrant and a beautiful innocent girl, the tyrant's luxuriously-decorated palace that is also full of traps, and a gang of henchmen serving the tyrant – both oversized goons and ninja-like assassins...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rg&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://animatedviews.com/2009/an-auteur-is-born-30-years-of-miyazakis-castle-of-cagliostro/ | title=An Auteur is Born – 30 Years Of Miyazaki’s Castle Of Cagliostro | publisher=Animated Views | date=15 December 2009 | accessdate=28 August 2013 | author=Greenberg, Raz | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819194944/http://animatedviews.com/2009/an-auteur-is-born-30-years-of-miyazakis-castle-of-cagliostro/ | archive-date=19 August 2013 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The staff added personal touches to the film, the most iconic being Lupin's car, the Fiat 500, was the car of head animator [[Yasuo Ōtsuka]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_a&quot; /&gt;  Clarisse's car in the chase scene is a [[Citroen 2CV]], which is Miyazaki's first car.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_a&quot; /&gt;

McCarthy describes the summery color palette of the film as matching the scenery and the characters, but notes the use of dark and light colors are used to emphasize the subplot of the dark and light sides of the Cagliostros.&lt;ref name=&quot;hm&quot; /&gt; The film's score was composed by series regular [[Yuji Ohno]], and varies between jazz, romance and orchestral music. Notably, it includes a variation of Lupin III's iconic TV theme.&lt;ref name=&quot;hm&quot; /&gt; The music was performed by You &amp; The Explosion Band, who had previously worked on the second television series. The main vocal song &quot;Fire Treasure&quot; was performed by Bobby (aka Toshie Kihara) and saw release as an LP single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lupin the 3rd The Castle of Cagliostro|url=http://vgmdb.net/album/40236|publisher=VGMdb.net|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first release of the soundtrack was ''Lupin the 3rd The Castle of Cagliostro Original Soundtrack BGM Collection'', an album containing extended versions of select cues from the film. It was originally sold on vinyl and cassette tape in 1983, but later saw release on CD in 1985 with several additional prints runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lupin the 3rd The Castle of Cagliostro Original Soundtrack BGM Collection|url=http://vgmdb.net/album/20816|publisher=VGMdb|accessdate=15 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215054847/http://vgmdb.net/album/20816|archive-date=15 December 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the entire score was finally released on a newly commissioned album entitled ''Lupin the 3rd: The Castle of Cagliostro – Music File'' and also contained 13 unused cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Romero|first=Anthony|title=Lupin the 3rd: The Castle of Cagliostro – Music File|url=http://www.tohokingdom.com/cd/lupin_cagliostro_musicfile_col.htm|publisher=Toho Kingdom|accessdate=15 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621050517/http://www.tohokingdom.com/cd/lupin_cagliostro_musicfile_col.htm|archive-date=21 June 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Castle of Cagliostro''{{'}}s  portrayal of the characters was changed to better identify with Miyazaki's concept of a &quot;hero&quot; and to remove a sense of apathy in the story.&lt;ref name=om /&gt; This resulted in Lupin being a happy-go-lucky and upbeat thief who drives and lives out of a [[Fiat 500]]; a sharp contrast to the scheming and lecherous Lupin who drives expensive cars like the [[Mercedes-Benz SSK]] because it was &quot;[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s favorite&quot;.&lt;ref name=om /&gt; The changes would also impact secondary characters like Jigen and Goemon, changing their serious and cold personalities into friendly and humorous; even the erotic elements involving the [[femme-fatale]] Fujiko were dropped.&lt;ref name=om /&gt;

[[Fred Patten]], who worked at [[Streamline Pictures]] was involved in the English adaptation of the film and was involved in the choice of title for the English release,

{{quote|The Japanese title is ''Lupin III: Cagliostro no Shiro'', which is literally ''Lupin III: Cagliostro of Castle'' {{sic}}.{{efn|''Cagliostro no Shiro'' actually translates to &quot;Castle of Cagliostro&quot;}} So which would be better in English; ''Cagliostro Castle'', ''Cagliostro's Castle'', or ''The Castle of Cagliostro''? It was my argument that ''The Castle of Cagliostro'' sounded the most sinister. Cagliostro Castle is just a castle's name, like Windsor Castle, but the Castle of Cagliostro emphasizes that it is the evil Count's lair!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/lost-in-translation/ | title=Lost In Translation | publisher=Cartoon Research | date=26 May 2013 | accessdate=28 August 2013 | author=Pattern, Fred | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805131002/http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/lost-in-translation/ | archive-date=5 August 2014 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Critical analysis ==
In his first feature length directorial role, Miyazaki deploys numerous examples of his style to great effect. Dani Cavallaro highlights the signature details of Miyazaki's style and form being displayed in this work and how it impacts the portrayal of the story.&lt;ref name=dc /&gt; Cagliostro, the country and setting, is depicted in meticulous detail and unconstrained by limitations of architecture, geography and culture, which can be described as &quot;''akogare no Paris''&quot; (Paris of our dreams), which is a fantastical view of Europe through Eastern eyes. The use of unexpected and unique camera angles and attention to individual movement of the characters are distinctive signatures of Miyazaki's style, including the opening heist scene which provides characterization and spirit to understanding the character of Lupin.&lt;ref name=dc /&gt; The changes made to the portrayal of the cast, depicting a heroic and selfless Lupin, a friendly Jigen, funny Goemon, and un-sexualized Fujiko, were initially not well received by fans. [[Otaku USA]]'s Surat described compared this shift to &quot;a [[James Bond]] movie where [James Bond] stayed at [[Motel 6]] and his &quot;Bond mobile&quot; was a [[Toyota Camry]]!&quot;&lt;ref name=om /&gt;

==Release==
The film's Japanese theatrical release was on 15 December 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;hm&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Hayao Miyazaki Master of Japanese Animation | publisher=Stone Bridge Press | author=McCarthy, Helen | year=1999 | pages=50–69 | isbn=1880656418}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Tokyo Movie Shinsha began screen testing the film in North America and it was notably shown at the [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]] in Boston for a marketing survey. It was later screened at other festivals during the 1980s, including FILMEX 82 in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Watching Anime, Reading Manga: 25 Years of Essays and Reviews |last1=Patten |first1=Fred|authorlink=Fred Patten|year=2004|page=209|isbn=1-880656-92-2 |publisher=Stone Bridge Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite resounding acclaim from the screenings, many of them were unsuccessful. According to [[Fred Patten]], the primary reason was that, &quot;most people did not bother to come to it since it was &quot;only&quot; an animated-cartoon feature, not a &quot;serious&quot; live-action movie.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CRsearch&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/my-top-ten-anime-part-1/ | title=My Top Ten Anime Part 1 by Fred Patten | publisher=Cartoon Research | date=7 September 2014 | accessdate=7 September 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402204750/http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/my-top-ten-anime-part-1/ | archive-date=2 April 2015 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== English releases ===
The American theatrical debut was on 3 April 1991 in New York City by [[Carl Macek]]'s [[Streamline Pictures]], with the home release following in October 1992.&lt;ref name=hm /&gt; Streamline's dub contains several deviations from the original Japanese script. Due to copyright issues with Maurice LeBlanc's estate, Lupin is referred to as &quot;the Wolf.&quot; Inspector Koichi Zenigata is erroneously named &quot;Keibu Zenigata,&quot; likely due to a translation error (keibu being the Japanese title for a police inspector). The UK release followed on 10 June 1996 by [[Manga Entertainment|Manga Video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Manga Mania |issn=0968-9575 |date=June 1996 |number=35 |page=4 |publisher=[[Manga Entertainment|Manga Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[StudioCanal UK|Optimum Releasing]] re-released ''Cagliostro'' in the UK after Manga Entertainment lost its license in the UK.&lt;ref name=or1&gt;{{cite web | url=http://press.optimumreleasing.net/dvd.php?id=193 | title=Optimum Releasing – Castle of Cagliostro, The | year=2010 | accessdate=27 August 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021205538/http://press.optimumreleasing.net/dvd.php?id=193 | archivedate=21 October 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new DVD features an anamorphic widescreen print with the original Japanese audio track as well as the Streamline dub, both in stereo.&lt;ref name=or1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://film.thedigitalfix.com/content/id/59288/the-castle-of-cagliostro.html | title=The Castle of Cagliostro | publisher=The Digital Fix | date=20 November 2005 | accessdate=27 August 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024102629/http://film.thedigitalfix.com/content/id/59288/the-castle-of-cagliostro.html | archive-date=24 October 2013 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Manga released the film on home video in the United States with a newly commissioned dub that adhered closer to the original script with the correct names restored. The DVD preserves the film in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1 widescreen and is non-anamorphic. It additionally features remastered audio and picture, but contains no extras. The same company later released a new special edition DVD of ''Cagliostro'' in 2006.&lt;ref name=rs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rightstuf.com/cgi-bin/catalogmgr/7To2jDftfvImX-NrS1/browse/item/69914/4/0/0 |title=Castle of Cagliostro Special Edition DVD |publisher=Rightstuf.com |accessdate=8 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120913082311/http://www.rightstuf.com/cgi-bin/catalogmgr/7To2jDftfvImX-NrS1/browse/item/69914/4/0/0 |archivedate=13 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DVD Talk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=DVD Talk|title=The Castle of Cagliostro – Special Edition|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/23472/castle-of-cagliostro-special-edition-the/|publisher=DVDTalk.com|accessdate=5 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022005734/http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/23472/castle-of-cagliostro-special-edition-the/|archive-date=22 October 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disc is double-sided with the film on side A and the extras on side B.

==Reception==
&lt;!-- NOTE: It needs a reliable source
The film was nominated for a [[Saturn Award for Best International Film]], losing to Canada's ''[[Scanners]]''.

At the Japanese box office, the film grossed {{¥|600 million}}&lt;ref name=&quot;DVD Commentary&quot;/&gt; ({{US$|{{To USD|600|JPN|year=2011}} million|long=no}}). The film's overseas screenings in 2007 and 2017 later grossed $152,775 in Italy and South Korea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rupan sansei: Kariosutoro no shiro (Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro) |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/intl/?page=&amp;id=_fRUPANSANSEIKARIO01 |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $142,425 in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lupin the Third: The Castle of Cagliostro (2017 re-release) (2017) |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lupincastleofcagliostro.htm |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing the film's worldwide gross to {{US$|7.82 million|long=no}}.

==Influence==
The film has itself been an influence in a range of other productions. There is an unconfirmed rumor that film director [[Steven Spielberg]] saw a screening of ''The Castle of Cagliostro'' in the early 80's. From that rumor, one would assume that Spielberg was so impressed with the film that it later influenced the action sequences in his ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' films and ''[[The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn]]''. There is no evidence of Spielberg quoting the film, but Manga Entertainment's DVD release quotes him saying: &quot;one of the greatest adventure movies of all time.&quot;&lt;ref name=rs /&gt; Another unverified statement has Spielberg calling the film's car chase &quot;one of the greatest chase sequences ever filmed&quot;. Some sources claim that Spielberg saw the film at the [[1980 Cannes Film Festival]],&lt;ref name=om /&gt; but, according to official Cannes sources, ''Castle of Cagliostro'' was not shown that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/archives/1980/allSelections.html | title=Official Selection 1980 : All the Selection | publisher=Cannes Film Festival | accessdate=16 July 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021214419/http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/archives/1980/allSelections.html | archive-date=21 October 2013 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cagliostro'' deeply influenced [[Pixar]] co-founder [[John Lasseter]], along with Miyazaki's later films; in October 2014, Lasseter delivered a [[keynote]] address to the [[Tokyo International Film Festival]] describing how Miyazaki's influence upon his own life and work began when he first saw a clip from ''Cagliostro''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brzeski&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brzeski|first1=Patrick|title=John Lasseter Pays Emotional Tribute to Hayao Miyazaki at Tokyo Film Festival|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/john-lasseter-pays-emotional-tribute-743635|accessdate=10 November 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=24 October 2014|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6qeMVKn7H?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/john-lasseter-pays-emotional-tribute-743635|archive-date=22 May 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' 1986 film ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'', co-directed by [[John Musker]] and [[Ron Clements]], paid homage to ''Cagliostro'' with the film's climactic Big Ben sequence.&lt;ref name=av /&gt; Another reference to the clock-tower fight is in &quot;The Clock King&quot; episode of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.&lt;ref name=av /&gt; [[Gary Trousdale]], co-director of Disney's ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', admitted that a scene at the end of ''Atlantis'', where the waters recede from the sunken city, was directly inspired from the ending in  ''Cagliostro''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee2001&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2001-05-15 |title=Probing the ''Atlantis'' mystery |first=Lee |last=Zion |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=15 May 2001 |accessdate=30 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709170112/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2001-05-15 |archive-date=9 July 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the sequence directors of ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' also mentioned ''Cagliostro'' as an influence; a brief shot where [[Bart Simpson]] rolls down the roof of the family house was inspired by Lupin running down the castle roof during his rescue attempt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Director2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=''The Simpsons Movie'' DVD |work=Director's Commentary |date=18 December 2007 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.
