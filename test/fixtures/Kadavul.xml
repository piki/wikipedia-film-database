==Plot==

Parvathi ([[Roja (actress)|Roja]]), a young woman, is a goddess believer while her father (V. Gopalakrishnan) is the priest of a temple. After a quarrel between two castes during a Hindu festival, the temple was closed off. Five years later, the temple reopens.

Muthu (Rahul) and Thenmozhi (Nandhini) are in love but they are not of the same caste. Velusamy (Karikalan), Thenmozhi's uncle, finds out their love and forces her to marry him.

K. Shanmugam ([[Mansoor Ali Khan (actor)|Mansoor Ali Khan]]), a corrupt [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]], kills a girl and blames Thamizharasan ([[C. Arunpandian|Arun Pandian]]). Thamizharasan fights against injustice and is a revolutionary. Angry, Thamizharasan tries to kill him but fails and eventually steals his money. In the process, Thamizharasan is injured and the prostitute Shenbagam (Rupasri) takes care of him.

Rajapandi ([[Velu Prabhakaran]]), an atheist, propagates the non-existence of God. One day, he saves Parvathi from her uncle K. Shanmugam and accidentally marries her. Soon, Rajapandi gets beaten by the devotees. In anger, Rajapandi challenges God to become a human and understand the humans, and God ([[Manivannan]]) appears as a human.
