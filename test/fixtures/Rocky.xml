'''''Rocky''''' is a 1976 American [[Sports film|sports]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[John G. Avildsen]] and both written by and starring [[Sylvester Stallone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rocky&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/20655/Rocky/|title=Rocky|work=TCM database|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It tells the [[rags to riches]] [[American Dream]] story of [[Rocky Balboa]], an uneducated but kind-hearted [[working class]] [[Italian-American]] boxer working as a debt collector for a [[loan shark]] in the slums of [[Philadelphia]].  Rocky, a small-time [[club fighter]], gets a shot at the [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|world heavyweight championship]]. The film also stars [[Talia Shire]] as Adrian, [[Burt Young]] as Adrian's brother Paulie, [[Burgess Meredith]] as Rocky's trainer [[Mickey Goldmill]], and [[Carl Weathers]] as the champion, [[Apollo Creed]].

The film, made on a budget of just over $1 million, was a [[sleeper hit]]; it earned $225 million in global box office receipts, becoming the [[1976 in film|highest-grossing film of 1976]], and went on to win three [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. The film received many positive reviews and turned Stallone into a major star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/guests/Sylvester_Stallone.shtml |title=Inside the Actors Studio with Sylvester Stallone |accessdate=28 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006041106/http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/guests/Sylvester_Stallone.shtml |archivedate=October  6, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;. ''Rocky'' is considered to be one of [[List of films considered the best#Sports|the greatest sports films ever made]] and was ranked as the second-best in the genre, after ''[[Raging Bull]]'', by the [[American Film Institute]] in 2008.

The film has spawned [[Rocky (film series)|seven sequels]]: ''[[Rocky II]]'' (1979), ''[[Rocky III]]'' (1982), ''[[Rocky IV]]'' (1985), ''[[Rocky V]]'' (1990), ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'' (2006), ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'' (2015) and Creed II (2018). Stallone portrays Rocky in all seven sequels, wrote the first five, and directed four (Avildsen returned to direct ''Rocky V'' and [[Ryan Coogler]] directed ''Creed''). An eighth film and direct sequel to ''Creed'', titled ''[[Creed II]]'', was released in 2018 with [[Steven Caple Jr.]] directing and Stallone returning to star and writing the script.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Please try to refrain from expanding the plot, adding POV style information and including aspects of the fight that the reader doesn't need to know and can learn from renting the film. WP:FICT says plot summary should be kept to a minimum. Furthermore, as per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should stay in between 400–700 words. --&gt;

In late 1975, the [[heavyweight]] [[boxing]] world champion, Apollo Creed, announces plans to hold a [[title bout]] in [[Philadelphia]] during the upcoming [[United States Bicentennial]]. However, he is informed five weeks from the fight date that his scheduled opponent is unable to compete due to an injured hand. With all other potential replacements booked up or otherwise unavailable, Creed decides to spice things up by giving a local contender a chance to challenge him. He settles in on [[Rocky Balboa|Robert &quot;Rocky&quot; Balboa]], an aspiring [[Southpaw stance|southpaw]] boxer from an Italian neighborhood of Philadelphia, known by the nickname &quot;The Italian Stallion&quot;.

Rocky meets with [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] Miles Jergens, unexpectedly presuming Creed is seeking local sparring partners. Reluctant at first, Rocky eventually agrees to the fight which will pay him $150,000. After several weeks of training, using whatever he can find, including meat carcasses as [[punching bag]]s, Rocky accepts an offer of assistance from former boxer Mickey &quot;Mighty Mick&quot; Goldmill, a respected trainer and former [[bantamweight]] fighter from the 1920s, who always criticized Rocky for wasting his potential.

Meanwhile, Rocky meets Adrian Pennino, who is working part-time at the J&amp;M Tropical Fish [[Pet store|pet store]]. He begins to build a romantic relationship with Adrian, culminating in a kiss. Adrian's brother, Paulie, becomes jealous of Rocky's success, but Rocky calms him by agreeing to advertise his [[Meat packing industry|meatpacking business]] before the upcoming fight. The night before the fight, Rocky begins to lose confidence after touring the arena. He confesses to Adrian that he does not expect to win, but is content to [[The distance (boxing)|go the distance]] against Creed and prove himself to everyone.

On [[New Year's Day]], the fight is held, with Creed making a dramatic entrance dressed as [[George Washington]] and then [[Uncle Sam]]. Taking advantage of his overconfidence, Rocky knocks him down in the first round—the first time that Creed has ever been knocked down. Humiliated, Creed takes Rocky more seriously for the rest of the fight, though his ego never fully fades. The fight goes on for the full fifteen rounds, with both combatants sustaining various injuries. As the fight progresses, Creed's superior skill is countered by Rocky's apparently unlimited ability to absorb punches, and his dogged refusal to go down. As the final round bell sounds, with both fighters locked in each other's arms, they promise to each other that there will be no rematch.

After the fight, the sportscasters and the audience go wild. Jergens announces over the loudspeaker that the fight was &quot;the greatest exhibition of guts and stamina in the history of the ring&quot;, and Rocky calls out repeatedly for Adrian, who runs down and comes into the ring as Paulie distracts arena security. As Jergens declares Creed the winner by virtue of a split decision (8:7, 7:8, 9:6), Adrian and Rocky embrace and profess their love to each other, not caring about the result of the fight.

==Production==

===Development===
[[Sylvester Stallone]] wrote the screenplay for ''Rocky'' in three and a half days, shortly after watching the championship match between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Chuck Wepner]] that took place at [[Richfield Coliseum]] in [[Richfield, Ohio]] on March 24, 1975. Wepner was TKO'd in the 15th round of the match by Ali, with few expecting him to last as long as he did. Despite the fact that the match motivated Stallone to begin work on ''Rocky'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Rocky Isn't Based on Me,' Says Stallone, 'But We Both Went the Distance'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/movies/bestpictures/rocky-ar.html|accessdate=December 1, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=November 1, 1976|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201172004/https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/movies/bestpictures/rocky-ar.html|archivedate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he has subsequently denied that Wepner provided any inspiration for the script.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN Wepner Recognized&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/page/IamChuckWepner/chuck-wepner-recognized-rocky-fame |title=Chuck Wepner finally recognized for 'Rocky' fame – ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2011-10-25 |accessdate=2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Real Rocky&quot;&gt;{{cite video | people=Feuerzeig, Jeff (Director) | date=2011-10-25 | title=The Real Rocky | medium=Motion picture | publisher=ESPN Films}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible inspirations for the film may have included characteristics of real-life boxers [[Rocky Marciano]] and [[Joe Frazier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Struby|first1=Tim|title=Marciano's career mark unique but flawed?|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2165594|website=[[ESPN]]|publisher=[[ESPN Inc.]]|accessdate=December 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201171638/http://espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2165594|archivedate=December 1, 2015|date=September 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McRae|first1=Donald|title=Still smokin' over Ali but there's no time for hatred now|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/nov/11/sportinterviews-boxing|website=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=December 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201171407/http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/nov/11/sportinterviews-boxing|archivedate=December 1, 2015|date=November 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Rocky Graziano]]'s autobiography ''Somebody Up There Likes Me'' and [[Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956 film)|the movie of the same name]]. Wepner filed a lawsuit which was eventually settled with Stallone for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Real Rocky&quot; /&gt;

[[United Artists]] liked Stallone's script, and viewed it as a possible vehicle for a well-established star such as [[Robert Redford]], [[Ryan O'Neal]], [[Burt Reynolds]], or [[James Caan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weisman|first1=Aly|title=Dirt-Poor Sylvester Stallone Turned Down $300,000 In 1976 To Ensure He Could Play 'Rocky'|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/sylvester-stallone-made-rocky-against-all-odds-2014-4|website=[[Business Insider]]|publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]]|accessdate=December 1, 2015|date=April 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stallone insisted upon portraying the title character himself, to the point of issuing an ultimatum. Stallone later said that he would never have forgiven himself, had the film become a success with somebody else in the lead. He also knew that producers [[Irwin Winkler]] and [[Robert Chartoff]]'s contract with the studio enabled them to &quot;greenlight&quot; a project if the budget was kept low enough. The producers also collateralized any possible losses with their big-budget entry, ''[[New York, New York (1977 film)|New York, New York]]'' (whose eventual losses were covered by ''Rocky''{{'s}} success).&lt;ref name = &quot;EW&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title = EW: The Right Hook: How Rocky Nabbed Best Picture | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,203553,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | first=Chris | last=Nashawaty | date=2002-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Neal Gabler]], ''ReelThirteen'', from [http://thirteen.org/ WNET], 2/22/2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The film's production budget ended up being $1,075,000, with a further $100,000 spent on producers' fees and $4.2 million on advertising costs.&lt;ref name=BlockWilson583&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Block|editor1-first=Alex Ben|editor2-last=Wilson|editor2-first=Lucy Autrey|year=2010|title=George Lucas's Blockbusting: A Decade-By-Decade Survey of Timeless Movies Including Untold Secrets of Their Financial and Cultural Success|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=9780061778896|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vpbuSXSSqdkC&amp;pg=PA583 583]|quote=The budget was $1,075,000 plus producer's fees of $100,000 ...

Although Chartoff and Winkler were enthusiastic about the script and the idea of Stallone playing the lead character, they were hesitant about having an unknown headline the film. The producers also had trouble casting other major characters in the story, with Apollo Creed and Adrian cast unusually late by production standards (both were ultimately cast on the same day). Real-life boxer [[Ken Norton]] was initially sought for the role of [[Apollo Creed]], but he pulled out and the role was ultimately given to [[Carl Weathers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vellin|first1=Bob|title=Former heavyweight champion Ken Norton dies at 70|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/boxing/2013/09/18/former-heavywegith-champion-ken-norton-die/2834521/|website=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|accessdate=December 2, 2015|date=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norton had had three fights with [[Muhammad Ali]], upon whom Creed was loosely based. According to ''The Rocky Scrapbook'', [[Carrie Snodgress]] was originally chosen to play Adrian, but a money dispute forced the producers to look elsewhere. [[Susan Sarandon]] auditioned for the role but was deemed too pretty for the character. After [[Talia Shire]]'s ensuing audition, Chartoff and Winkler, along with Avildsen, insisted that she play the part.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Boxer [[Joe Frazier]] has a [[cameo appearance]] in the film. The character of Apollo Creed was influenced by outspoken boxer [[Muhammad Ali]] who fought Frazier three times. During the [[49th Academy Awards]] ceremony in 1977, Ali and Stallone staged a brief comic confrontation to show Ali was not offended by the film. Some of the plot's most memorable moments—Rocky's carcass-punching scenes and Rocky running up the steps of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], as part of his training regimen—are taken from the real-life exploits of Joe Frazier, for which he received no credit.&lt;ref name = &quot;Joe Frazier Inspiration&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Still smokin' over Ali but there's no time for hatred now|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/nov/11/sportinterviews-boxing|work=The Guardian|first=Donald|last=McRae|date=11 November 2008|accessdate=3 October 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the film's comparatively low budget, members of Stallone's family played minor roles. His father rings the bell to signal the start and end of a round, his brother [[Frank Stallone|Frank]] plays a street corner singer, and his first wife, Sasha, was [[Unit still photographer|stills photographer]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Stalone's wife Rocky photographer&quot; &gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0038664/bio |publisher= Internet Movie Database |title= Czack, Sasha}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cameos include former Philadelphia and then-current Los Angeles television [[Sports commentator|sportscaster]] [[Stu Nahan]] playing himself, alongside radio and TV broadcaster Bill Baldwin; and [[Lloyd Kaufman]], founder of the independent film company [[Troma Entertainment|Troma]], appearing as a drunk. Diana Lewis, then a news anchor in Los Angeles and later in Detroit, has a small scene as a TV news reporter. [[Tony Burton]] appeared as Apollo Creed's trainer, [[Tony &quot;Duke&quot; Evers]], a role he would reprise in the entire ''Rocky'' series, though he is not given an official name until ''Rocky II''. Though uncredited, [[Michael Dorn]], who would later gain fame as the [[Klingon]] [[Worf]] in ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', made his acting debut as Creed's bodyguard.&lt;ref name=Trek&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/dorn |title=Star Trek Database – Dorn, Michael |work=Star Trek Database |publisher=CBS Entertainment |accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Principal photography for ''Rocky'' began on January 9, 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stallone starts filming Rocky|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/stallone-starts-filming-rocky|website=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]|publisher=[[A&amp;E Networks]]|accessdate=December 2, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202182201/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/stallone-starts-filming-rocky|archivedate=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming took place primarily throughout [[Philadelphia]], with a few scenes being shot in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rocky film locations|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/r/rocky.html#.Vl84HcpP0uI|website=The Worldwide Guide To Movie Locations|accessdate=December 2, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906102019/http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/r/rocky.html|archivedate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inventor/operator [[Garrett Brown]]'s new [[Steadicam]] was used to accomplish smooth photography while running alongside Rocky during the film's Philadelphia street jogging/training sequences and the run up the Art Museum's flight of stairs, now colloquially known as the [[Rocky Steps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stairway to Heaven|url=http://www.dga.org/Craft/DGAQ/All-Articles/1201-Winter-2012/Shot-to-Remember-Rocky.aspx|publisher=DGA|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used for some of the shots in the fight scenes and can be seen at the ringside during some wide shots of the final fight. ''Rocky'' is often erroneously cited as the first film to use the Steadicam, although it was actually the third, after ''[[Bound for Glory (film)|Bound for Glory]]'' and ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lserv2.dtopinc.com/tiffen/staging_html/tiffen_news_Steadicam30th_Anniv.html |title=Steadicam 30th anniversary press release |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430033456/http://lserv2.dtopinc.com/tiffen/staging_html/tiffen_news_Steadicam30th_Anniv.html |archivedate=April 30, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain elements of the story were altered during filming. The original script had a darker tone: Mickey was portrayed as [[Racism|racist]], and the script ended with Rocky throwing the fight after realizing he did not want to be part of the [[professional boxing]] world after all.&lt;ref name=&quot;EW&quot; /&gt;

During filming, both Stallone and Weathers suffered injuries during the shooting of the final fight; Stallone suffered bruised ribs and Weathers suffered a damaged nose, the opposite injuries of what their characters had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Neuwirth |first=Aaron |date=26 November 2015 |title=Movie Trivia Thursday (Nov. 26): 5 Cool Facts About 5 Classic Boxing Films |url=http://www.ranthollywood.com/2015/11/26/movie-trivia-thursday-nov-26-5-cool-facts-about-these-classic-boxing-films/ |publisher=RantHollywood |access-date=4 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620070011/http://www.ranthollywood.com/2015/11/26/movie-trivia-thursday-nov-26-5-cool-facts-about-these-classic-boxing-films/ |archivedate=June 20, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first date between Rocky and Adrian, in which Rocky bribes a janitor to allow them to skate after closing hours in a deserted ice skating rink, was shot that way only because of budgetary pressures. This scene was originally scheduled to be shot in a skating rink during regular business hours. However, the producers decided that they could not afford to hire the hundreds of extras that would have been necessary for that scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReelLife&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Merron|first1=Jeff|title=Reel Life: 'Rocky'|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020529.html|website=[[ESPN]]|publisher=[[ESPN Inc.]]|accessdate=December 2, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202171945/http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020529.html|archivedate=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poster seen above the ring before Rocky fights Apollo Creed shows Rocky wearing red shorts with a white stripe when he actually wears white shorts with a red stripe. When Rocky points this out, he is told that &quot;it doesn't really matter, does it?&quot; According to director Avildsen's DVD commentary, this was an actual mistake made by the props department that they could not afford to rectify, so Stallone wrote the brief scene to ensure the audience did not see it as a goof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/72-hard-hitting-facts-about-the-rocky-movies-131837786.html |title=72 Hard-Hitting Facts About the 'Rocky' Movies |publisher=Yahoo.com |date=2015-11-24 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Carl Weathers, coincidentally, wore white-striped red shorts for the Creed-Balboa rematch in ''[[Rocky II]]''.) Avildsen said that the same situation arose with Rocky's robe. When it came back from the costume department, it was far too baggy for Stallone.  Because the robe arrived on the day of filming the scene and there was no chance of replacing or altering it, instead of ignoring this and risking the audience laughing at it, Stallone wrote the dialogue where Rocky himself points out the robe is too big.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screencrush.com/rocky-trivia-facts/ |title=Don't Be a Bum, Check Out These 10 'Rocky' Facts |publisher=Screencrush.com |date=2015-11-23 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{Main article|Rocky (soundtrack)}}

The [[film score|musical score]] for ''Rocky'' was composed by [[Bill Conti]], who previously composed a score for director [[John G.

===Critical response===
''Rocky'' received positive reviews at the time of its release. [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave it 4 out of 4 stars and said that Stallone reminded him of &quot;the young [[Marlon Brando]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date= January 1, 1977 &lt;!-- although the online version says 1976, it was actually 1977 --&gt; |title = Rocky Movie Review &amp; Film Summary | first=Roger | last=Ebert | authorlink=Roger Ebert | url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/rocky-1976 | access-date=October 9, 2017 | newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | via=RogerEbert.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Box Office Magazine'' claimed that audiences would be &quot;touting Sylvester 'Sly' Stallone as a new star&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=1976-11-22 |title=Box Office Magazine Rocky Review |url=http://www.boxoffice.com/scripts/fiw.dll?GetReview?&amp;where=ID&amp;terms=4828 |accessdate=2006-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123101307/http://www.boxoffice.com/scripts/fiw.dll?GetReview%3F&amp;where=ID&amp;terms=4828 |archivedate=November 23, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Arizona Daily Star Review |url=http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=107744&amp;section=pressQuote |accessdate= 2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Rich]] liked the film, calling it &quot;almost 100 per cent [[schmaltz]],&quot; but favoring it over the cynicism that was prevalent in movies at that time, although he referred to the plot as &quot;gimmicky&quot; and the script &quot;heavy-handed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Rich. ''[[The New York Post]]'' November 22, 1976.  p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Several reviews, including [[Richard Eder]]'s (as well as Canby's negative review), compared the work to that of [[Frank Capra]].

The film, however, did not escape criticism. [[Vincent Canby]], of ''[[The New York Times]]'', called it &quot;pure '30s make believe&quot; and dismissed both Stallone's acting and Avildsen's directing, calling the latter &quot;none too decisive&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date = November 22, 1976|accessdate = 23 September 2006|url = http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?_r=1&amp;title1=Rocky%20(Movie)&amp;title2=&amp;reviewer=VINCENT%20CANBY&amp;pdate=19761122&amp;v_id=|title = Vincent Canby Rocky Review for New York Times|work = The New York Times|first = Manohla|last = Dargis}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Sarris]] found the Capra comparisons disingenuous:  &quot;Capra's movies projected more despair deep down than a movie like ''Rocky'' could envisage, and most previous ring movies have been much more cynical about the fight scene,&quot; and, commenting on Rocky's work as a loan shark, says that the film &quot;teeters on the edge of sentimentalizing gangsters.&quot;  Sarris also found Meredith &quot;oddly cast in the kind of part the late [[James Gleason]] used to pick his teeth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Village Voice]]'' November 22, 1976, p.61&lt;/ref&gt;

Four decades later, the film enjoys a reputation as a classic and still receives nearly universal praise; ''Rocky'' holds a 93% &quot;Certified Fresh&quot; rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 57 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The site's consensus states: &quot;This story of a down-on-his-luck boxer is thoroughly predictable, but Sylvester Stallone's script and stunning performance in the title role brush aside complaints.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Rocky |website=Rotten Tomatoes| url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1017776-rocky/| accessdate = July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the positive online reviews came from the [[BBC]] Films website, with both reviewer Almar Haflidason and BBC online users giving it 5/5 stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/03/12/rocky_1976_review.shtml|title = Rocky @ BBC Films|accessdate=2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Steven J. Schneider's ''1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die'', Schneider says the film is &quot;often overlooked as schmaltz.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Schneider| first = Stephen Jay | title = 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die (Revised Edition) |publisher = New Burlington Books|year= 2005 |location = London, England| page = 615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Directors Guild of America]] awarded ''Rocky'' its [[Directors Guild of America Award|annual award]] for best film of the year in 1976, and in 2006, Sylvester Stallone's original screenplay for ''Rocky'' was selected for the [[Writers Guild of America Award]] as the 78th best screenplay of all time.&lt;ref name=Screenplay&gt;{{cite web|title=The 101 Best Screenplays |author=[[Writers Guild of America, West]] |url=http://www.wga.org/subpage_newsevents.aspx?id=1807 |accessdate=2006-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813151310/http://www.wga.org/subpage_newsevents.aspx?id=1807 |archivedate=August 13, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rocky Movie Legacy in Philadelphia Old City.jpg|thumb|Rocky merchandise and iconography is commonplace in Philadelphia.]]
The famous scene of Rocky running up the steps of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] has become a cultural icon, with the steps acquiring the vernacular title of &quot;Rocky Steps&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holzman|first1=Laura|title=Rocky|url=http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/rocky/|website=Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia|publisher=Mid-Atlantic Regional Center for the Humanities|accessdate=December 2, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202174125/http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/rocky/|archivedate=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, a statue of Rocky, commissioned by Stallone for ''[[Rocky III]]'', was placed at the top of the [[Rocky Steps]]. City Commerce Director [[Dick Doran]] claimed that Stallone and Rocky had done more for the city's image than &quot;anyone since [[Benjamin Franklin|Ben Franklin]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RockyStatue&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Avery|first1=Ron|title=Rocky Statue|url=http://www.ushistory.org/oddities/rocky.htm|website=UShistory.org|publisher=[[Independence Hall Association]]|accessdate=December 2, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110174827/http://www.ushistory.org/oddities/rocky.htm|archivedate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differing opinions of the statue and its placement led to a relocation to the sidewalk outside the Spectrum Arena, although the statue was temporarily returned to the top of the steps in 1990 for ''[[Rocky V]]'', and again in 2006 for the 30th anniversary of the original ''Rocky'' (although this time it was placed at the bottom of the steps). Later that year, it was permanently moved to a spot next to the steps.&lt;ref name=&quot;RockyStatue&quot;/&gt;

The scene is frequently parodied in the media. In the 2008 movie ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]'', Zohan's nemesis, Phantom, goes through a parodied training sequence finishing with him running up a desert dune and raising his hands in victory. In the fourth-season finale of ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', as the credits roll at the end of the episode, Will is seen running up the same steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art; however, as he celebrates after finishing his climb, he passes out in exhaustion, and while he lies unconscious on the ground, a pickpocket steals his wallet and his wool hat. In ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'', there is a scene where Sherman Klump ([[Eddie Murphy]]) struggles to and eventually succeeds at running up a lengthy flight of steps on his college campus, victoriously throwing punches at the top.

In 2006, [[E!]] named the &quot;Rocky Steps&quot; scene #13 in its ''101 Most Awesome Moments in Entertainment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118091605/http://www.eonline.com/On/101/MostAwesome/List/index5.html|url=http://www.eonline.com/On/101/MostAwesome/List/index5.html|archivedate=2006-01-18|accessdate=2015-12-12|deadurl=yes|title = E!

During the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] torch relay, Philadelphia native [[Dawn Staley]] was chosen to run up the museum steps. In [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004, Presidential candidate]] [[John Kerry]] ended his pre-convention campaign at the foot of the steps before going to Boston to accept his party's nomination for President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philly.com |url=http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/9258078.htm |accessdate=2006-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217163800/http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/9258078.htm |archivedate=December 17, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
