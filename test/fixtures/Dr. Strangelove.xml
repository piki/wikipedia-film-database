[[File:Dr. Strangelove (1964) - Trailer.webm|thumb|''Dr. Strangelove'', trailer]]
'''''Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb''''', more commonly known simply as '''''Dr. Strangelove''''', is a 1964 [[black comedy]] film that satirizes the [[Cold War]] fears of a nuclear conflict between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]]. The film was directed, produced, and co-written by [[Stanley Kubrick]] and stars [[Peter Sellers]], [[George C. Scott]], [[Sterling Hayden]] and [[Slim Pickens]]. Production took place in the United Kingdom. The film is loosely based on [[Peter George (author)|Peter George]]'s [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] novel ''[[Red Alert (novel)|Red Alert]]'' (1958).

The story concerns an unhinged [[United States Air Force]] general who orders a [[first strike]] [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]] on the Soviet Union. It separately follows the [[President of the United States]], his advisors, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and a [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) exchange officer as they attempt to prevent the crew of a [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] plane (who were ordered by the general) from nuking the Soviets and starting an atomic holocaust.

The film is often considered one of the best comedies ever made, and, not so frequently, one of the greatest films of all time. In 1998, the American Film Institute ranked it twenty-sixth in [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|its list of the best American movies]] (in the 2007 edition, the film ranked thirty-ninth), and in 2000, it was listed as number three on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs|its list of the funniest American films]]. In 1989, the United States [[Library of Congress]] included ''Dr. Strangelove'' as one of the first twenty-five films selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=September 19, 1989|title=ENTERTAINMENT: Film Registry Picks First 25 Movies|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-09-19-mn-347-story.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|access-date=April 22, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[United States Air Force]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] Jack D. Ripper is commander of Burpelson Air Force Base, which houses the [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) 843rd Bomb Wing, flying [[B-52 bomber]]s armed with [[hydrogen bomb]]s. The 843rd Wing is flying on airborne alert, two hours from their targets inside the [[USSR]].

[[File:Dr. Strangelove - Ripper and Mandrake.png|thumb|left|Ripper tells Mandrake that he discovered the Communist plot to pollute all Americans' &quot;precious bodily fluids&quot; during &quot;the physical act of love&quot;.]]

General Ripper orders his [[Executive officer#Military|executive officer]], [[Group Captain]] Lionel Mandrake of the UK [[Royal Air Force]], to put the base on alert, and to issue &quot;Wing Attack Plan R&quot; to the patrolling aircraft, one of which is commanded by Major T. J. &quot;King&quot; Kong. All of the aircraft commence an attack flight on the [[USSR]] and set their radios to allow communications only through their [[CRM 114 (fictional device)|CRM 114 discriminator]]s, which was designed to accept only communications preceded by a secret three-letter code known only to General Ripper. Mandrake discovers that no war order has been issued by the Pentagon and he tries to stop Ripper, who locks them both in his office. Ripper tells Mandrake that he believes the [[Water_fluoridation_controversy#Communist_conspiracy_theory_(1940s–1960s)|Soviets have been using fluoridation]] of the American water supplies to pollute the &quot;precious bodily fluids&quot; of Americans. Mandrake realizes that Ripper has gone insane.

In the [[Joint War Room|War Room]] at the Pentagon, General Buck Turgidson briefs President Merkin Muffley and other officers about how Plan R enables a senior officer to launch a strike against the Soviets if [[decapitation strike|all superiors have been killed in a first strike]] on the United States. Turgidson reports that his men are trying every possible three-letter CRM code to issue the stand-down order, but that could take over two days and the planes are due to reach their targets in a couple of hours. Muffley orders the [[U.S. Army]] to storm the base and arrest General Ripper. Turgidson then attempts to convince Muffley to let the attack continue, but Muffley refuses to be party to a nuclear [[first strike]]. Instead, he brings Soviet ambassador Alexei de Sadeski into the War Room to telephone [[Soviet Premier]] Dimitri Kissov on the &quot;[[Moscow–Washington hotline|hot line]]&quot;. Muffley warns the Premier of the impending attack and offers to reveal the positions of the [[bomber]]s and targets so that the Soviets can protect themselves.

After a heated discussion in Russian with the Premier, the ambassador informs President Muffley that the Soviet Union has created a [[Doomsday device|doomsday machine]], which consists of many buried [[cobalt bomb|bombs jacketed with &quot;cobalt-thorium G&quot;]] connected to a computer network set to detonate them automatically should any nuclear attack strike the country. Within two months after detonation, the cobalt-thorium G would encircle the planet in a radioactive &quot;doomsday shroud&quot;, wiping out all human and animal life, rendering the surface of the Earth uninhabitable for about 93 years. The device cannot be dismantled or &quot;untriggered&quot;, as it is programmed to explode if any such attempt is made. When the President's wheelchair-bound scientific advisor, the former [[Nazi German]] Dr. Strangelove, points out that such a doomsday machine would only be an effective deterrent if everyone knew about it, de Sadeski replies that the Soviet Premier had planned to reveal its existence to the world the following week.

Meanwhile, [[U.S. Army]] troops arrive at Burpelson, still sealed by Ripper's order, to take over the base after a heated firefight with Air Force security policemen. General Ripper then shoots and kills himself, while Mandrake identifies Ripper's CRM code from his desk blotter (&quot;OPE,&quot; a variant of both ''Peace on Earth'' and ''Purity of Essence'')&lt;ref name=Kramer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kramer|first1=Peter|title=Dr. Strangelove or: How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1844577798|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GQkoBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT53&amp;q=dr%20strangelove%20ope%20recall%20code%20%22peace%20on%20earth%22|accessdate=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relays this code to the Pentagon. Using the recall code, SAC successfully recalls all of the bombers but one. No one in the War Room knows that a Soviet [[surface-to-air missile]] has damaged the fuel tanks of that plane and destroyed its radio equipment, making it impossible to recall this particular plane even with the correct recall code.

[[File:Dr. Strangelove - Riding the Bomb.png|thumb|Bomber commander Major T. J. Kong riding the bomb down.]]
Muffley discloses the plane's target to help the Soviets find it, but its commanding officer, Major Kong, with his fuel dwindling, has switched to a closer backup target instead. As the plane approaches the new target, the crew is unable to open the damaged bomb bay doors. Kong enters the [[bomb bay]] and repairs the broken electrical wiring while sitting on the [[H-bomb]], whereupon the doors open and the bomb is dropped. With Kong straddling it as a cowboy would a [[bucking bull]], the bomb falls and detonates over a Soviet [[ICBM]] site.

Back in the War Room, Dr. Strangelove, resisting the urge to fall into Nazi habits of saluting and referring to the President as &quot;Mein Fuhrer&quot;, recommends that the President gather several hundred thousand people to live in deep underground mines where the radiation will not penetrate. He suggests a 10:1 female-to-male ratio for a breeding program to repopulate the Earth once the radiation has subsided. Turgidson, worried that the Soviets will do the same, warns about a &quot;[[missile gap|mineshaft gap]]&quot;, while Alexei secretly photographs the war room, something Turgidson had earlier attempted to frame him for doing. Dr. Strangelove declares he has a plan, but then rises from his wheelchair and announces &quot;Mein Führer, I can walk!&quot; as the Doomsday Machine activates. The film ends with a montage of many nuclear explosions, accompanied by [[Vera Lynn]]'s version of the popular World War II song &quot;[[We'll Meet Again]]&quot;.

[[Columbia Pictures]] agreed to finance the film if [[Peter Sellers]] played at least four major roles. The condition stemmed from the studio's opinion that much of the success of Kubrick's previous film ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' (1962) was based on Sellers's performance in which his single character assumes a number of identities. Sellers had also played three roles in ''[[The Mouse That Roared (film)|The Mouse That Roared]]'' (1959). Kubrick accepted the demand, later explaining that &quot;such crass and grotesque stipulations are the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of the motion-picture business&quot;.&lt;ref name=Southern/&gt;&lt;ref name=Southern2&gt;Lee Hill, [http://www.altx.com/int2/terry.southern.html &quot;Interview with a Grand Guy&quot;]: interview with Terry Southern&lt;/ref&gt;

Sellers ended up playing three of the four roles written for him. He had been expected to play Air Force Major T. J. &quot;King&quot; Kong, the [[B-52 Stratofortress]] aircraft commander, but from the beginning, Sellers was reluctant. He felt his workload was too heavy, and he worried he would not properly portray the character's [[Texas accent]]. Kubrick pleaded with him, and he asked the screenwriter [[Terry Southern]] (who had been raised in Texas) to record a tape with Kong's lines spoken in the correct accent. Using Southern's tape, Sellers managed to get the accent right, and he started acting in the scenes in the aircraft, but then sprained his ankle and he could not work in the cramped cockpit set.&lt;ref name=Southern/&gt;&lt;ref name=Southern2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the fictionalized [[biopic]] ''[[The Life and Death of Peter Sellers]]'', it is suggested that Sellers faked the injury as a way to force Kubrick to release him from the contractual obligation to play this fourth role.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sellers is said to have [[ad libitum|improvised much of his dialogue]], with Kubrick incorporating the ad-libs into the written screenplay so the improvised lines became part of the canonical screenplay, a practice known as [[retroscripting]].&lt;ref name=Inside&gt;&quot;Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove,&quot; a documentary included with the 40th Anniversary Special Edition DVD of the film&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- 15m 31s Alexander Walker, 17m 50s Pamela Carlton --&gt; &lt;!-- Vincent LoBrutto's book on Stanley Kubrick? --&gt;

====Group Captain Lionel Mandrake====
According to film critic [[Alexander Walker (critic)|Alexander Walker]], the author of biographies of both Sellers and Kubrick, the role of [[Group Captain]] Lionel Mandrake was the easiest of the three for Sellers to play, since he was aided by his experience of mimicking his superiors while serving in the [[Royal Air Force]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=Inside/&gt;&lt;!-- 15m 58s --&gt; There is also a heavy resemblance to Sellers' friend and occasional co-star [[Terry-Thomas]] and the [[prosthetic]]-limbed RAF ace Sir [[Douglas Bader]].

====President Merkin Muffley====
For his performance as President Merkin Muffley, Sellers assumed the accent of an American [[Midwestern United States|Midwesterner]]. Sellers drew inspiration for the role from [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]],&lt;ref name=Inside/&gt;&lt;!-- 16m 54s, Alexander Walker --&gt; a former [[Illinois]] governor who was the Democratic candidate for the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election|1956 presidential elections]] and the U.N. ambassador during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].

In early takes, Sellers faked [[common cold|cold]] symptoms to emphasize the character's apparent weakness. That caused frequent laughter among the film crew, ruining several takes. Kubrick ultimately found this comic portrayal inappropriate, feeling that Muffley should be a serious character.&lt;ref name=Inside/&gt;&lt;!-- 16m 25s Ken Adam, 16m 54s Alexander Walker --&gt; In later takes Sellers played the role straight, though the President's cold is still evident in several scenes.

In keeping with Kubrick's satirical character names, a &quot;[[merkin]]&quot; is a pubic hair wig. The president is bald, and his last name is &quot;Muffley&quot;; both are additional homages to a merkin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oed.com/start;jsessionid=361B5C597576A1700D333C6EE7CE8746?authRejection=true&amp;url=%2Fview%2FEntry%2F116815%3Frskey%3DjIHCjp%26result%3D1|title=Oxford English Dictionary: Merkin|website=www.oed.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dr. Strangelove====
Dr. Strangelove is an ex-[[Nazism|Nazi]] scientist, suggesting [[Operation Paperclip]], the US effort to recruit top German technical talent at the end of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Geddes, &quot;[http://www.thesatirist.com/films/DoctorStrangelove.html Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)]&quot;; ''The Satirist'', December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beverly Merrill Kelley, ''Reelpolitik II: Political Ideologies in '50s and '60s Films''; Oxford: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2004; p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DgfTlr4ScSIC&amp;pg=PA26 263].&lt;/ref&gt; He serves as President Muffley's scientific adviser in the War Room. When General Turgidson wonders aloud what kind of name &quot;Strangelove&quot; is, saying to Mr. Staines ([[Jack Creley]]) that it is not a &quot;[[Kraut]] name&quot;, Staines responds that Strangelove's original German surname was ''Merkwürdigliebe'' (&quot;Strange love&quot; in German) and that &quot;he changed it when he became a citizen&quot;. Twice in the film, Strangelove accidentally addresses the president as ''Mein Führer''. Dr. Strangelove did not appear in the book ''Red Alert''.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Townsend, et al., &quot;Red Alert&quot; in John Tibbetts &amp; James Welsh (eds.), ''The Encyclopedia of Novels into Films'', New York, 1999, pp. 183–186&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[John von Neumann]] proposed the strategy of [[mutual assured destruction]]]]

The character is an amalgamation of [[RAND Corporation]] strategist [[Herman Kahn]], mathematician and [[Manhattan Project]] principal [[John von Neumann]], rocket scientist [[Wernher von Braun]] (a central figure in Nazi Germany's rocket development program recruited to the US after the war), and [[Edward Teller]], the &quot;father of the [[hydrogen bomb]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Boyer, &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; in Mark C. Carnes (ed.), ''Past Imperfect: History According to the Movies'', New York, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a common misconception that the character was based on [[Henry Kissinger]], but Kubrick and Sellers denied this;&lt;ref name=moviediva&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviediva.com/MD_root/reviewpages/MDDrStrangelove.htm|title=Dr Strangelove|publisher=moviediva.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sellers said, &quot;Strangelove was never modeled after Kissinger—that's a popular misconception. It was always Wernher von Braun.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Starr |first=Michael Seth |title=Peter Sellers: A Film History |page=100 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-89950-512-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Henry Kissinger points out in his memoirs that at the time of the writing of ''Dr. Strangelove'', he was an unknown academic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/letter/mg18224505-100-the-real-dr-strangelove/ |title=The real Dr Strangelove |work=New Scientist |accessdate=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wheelchair-using Strangelove furthers a Kubrick trope of the menacing, seated antagonist, first depicted in ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' through the character &quot;Dr. Zaempf&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/836-lolita|title=Lolita|work=The Criterion Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strangelove's accent was influenced by that of Austrian-American photographer [[Weegee]], who worked for Kubrick as a special photographic effects consultant.&lt;ref name=Inside/&gt; Strangelove's appearance echoes the mad scientist archetype as seen in the character [[Rotwang]] in [[Fritz Lang]]'s film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927). Sellers's Strangelove takes from Rotwang the single black gloved hand (which, in Rotwang's case is mechanical, because of a lab accident), the wild hair and, most importantly, his ability to avoid being controlled by political power.&lt;ref&gt;Frayling, Christopher. ''Mad, Bad, and Dangerous?: The Scientist and the Cinema''. London: Reaktion, 2006. p.26&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alexander Walker, Sellers improvised Dr. Strangelove's lapse into the [[Nazi salute]], borrowing one of Kubrick's black leather gloves for the uncontrollable hand that makes the gesture. Dr. Strangelove apparently suffers from [[alien hand syndrome]]. Kubrick wore the gloves on the set to avoid being burned when handling hot lights, and Sellers, recognizing the potential connection to Lang's work, found them to be menacing.&lt;ref name=Inside/&gt;

===Slim Pickens as Major T. J. &quot;King&quot; Kong===
[[File:Dr. Strangelove - Wing Attack Plan R.png|thumb|Wing Attack Plan R, fresh from the cockpit's safe, allows a nuclear strike without the President's authorization.]]

[[Slim Pickens]], an established [[character actor]] and veteran of many Western films, was eventually chosen to replace Sellers as Major Kong after Sellers' injury. Terry Southern's biographer, Lee Hill, said the part was originally written with [[John Wayne]] in mind, and that Wayne was offered the role after Sellers was injured, but he immediately turned it down.&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;Lee Hill, ''A Grand Guy: The Life and Art of Terry Southern'' (Bloomsbury, 2001), pp.118–119&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Blocker]] of the ''[[Bonanza]]'' western television series was approached to play the part, but according to [[Terry Southern|Southern]], Blocker's agent rejected the script as being &quot;too [[pinko]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0088779/bio|title=Dan Blocker|website=IMDb|accessdate=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick then recruited Pickens, whom he knew from his brief involvement in a [[Marlon Brando]] western film project that was eventually filmed as ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]''.&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt;

His fellow actor [[James Earl Jones]] recalls, &quot;He was Major Kong on and off the set—he didn't change a thing—his temperament, his language, his behavior.&quot; Pickens was not told that the movie was a black comedy, and he was only given the script for scenes he was in, to get him to play it &quot;straight&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.phenry.org/movies/movienight/strangelove.php |title=Movie Night! |publisher=Phenry.org |date=February 22, 1999 |accessdate=March 6, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105093907/http://www.phenry.org/movies/movienight/strangelove.php |archivedate=November 5, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubrick's biographer John Baxter explained, in the documentary ''Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove'':
{{quote|As it turns out, Slim Pickens had never left the United States. He had to hurry and get his first passport. He arrived on the set, and somebody said, &quot;Gosh, he's arrived in costume!&quot;, not realizing that that's how he always dressed&amp;nbsp;... with the cowboy hat and the fringed jacket and the cowboy boots—and that he wasn't putting on the character—that's the way he talked.}}

Pickens, who had previously played only supporting and character roles, said that his appearance as Maj. Kong greatly improved his career. He later commented, &quot;After ''Dr. Strangelove'' the roles, the dressing rooms, and the checks all started getting bigger.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001620/bio|title=Slim Pickens|website=IMDb|accessdate=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===George C. Scott as General Buck Turgidson===
[[File:Dr. Strangelove - General Buck Turgidson.png|thumb|General Buck Turgidson imitating a low-flying B-52 &quot;frying chickens in a barnyard&quot;]]
Kubrick tricked Scott into playing the role of Gen. Turgidson far more ridiculously than Scott was comfortable doing. Kubrick talked Scott into doing over-the-top &quot;practice&quot; takes, which Kubrick told Scott would never be used, as a way to warm up for the &quot;real&quot; takes. Kubrick used these takes in the final film, causing Scott to swear never to work with Kubrick again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=James Earl Jones |url=http://atomiccafe.tribe.net/thread/f4a9a3d6-0f96-45c5-83f1-62ff060f2375 |title=A Bombardier's Reflection |publisher=Opinionjournal.com |date=November 16, 2004 |accessdate=March 6, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819183020/http://atomiccafe.tribe.net/thread/f4a9a3d6-0f96-45c5-83f1-62ff060f2375 |archivedate=August 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the filming, Kubrick and Scott had different opinions regarding certain scenes, but Kubrick got Scott to conform largely by repeatedly beating him at chess, which they played frequently on the set.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.ts.html &quot;Kubrick on The Shining&quot;]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703101856/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.ts.html |date=July 3, 2007 }} from Michel Ciment, 'Kubrick', Holt, Rinehart, and Winston; 1st American ed edition (1983), {{ISBN|0-03-061687-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott, a skilled player himself, later said that while he and Kubrick may not have always seen eye to eye, he respected Kubrick immensely for his skill at chess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/celebrating-kubrick-dr-strangelove-50 |title=Celebrating Kubrick's Dr Strangelove at 50 |work=BFI |accessdate=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

===Novel and screenplay===
[[Stanley Kubrick]] started with nothing but a vague idea to make a thriller about a nuclear accident that built on the widespread [[Cold War]] fear for survival.&lt;ref name=Siano&gt;Brian Siano, [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0017.html &quot;A Commentary on Dr. Strangelove&quot;], 1995&lt;/ref&gt; While doing research, Kubrick gradually became aware of the subtle and paradoxical &quot;[[balance of terror]]&quot; between nuclear powers. At Kubrick's request, [[Alastair Francis Buchan|Alastair Buchan]] (the head of the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies|Institute for Strategic Studies]]) recommended the thriller novel ''[[Red Alert (novel)|Red Alert]]'' by [[Peter George (author)|Peter George]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Walker, &quot;Stanley Kubrick Directs,&quot; Harcourt Brace Co, 1972, {{ISBN|0-15-684892-9}}, cited in Brian Siano, [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0017.html &quot;A Commentary on Dr. Strangelove&quot;], 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick was impressed with the book, which had also been praised by [[game theory|game theorist]] and future [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] winner [[Thomas Schelling]] in an article written for the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'' and reprinted in ''[[The Observer]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Phone interview with Thomas Schelling by Sharon Ghamari-Tabrizi, published in her book ''The Worlds of Herman Kahn; The Intuitive Science of Thermonuclear War'' (Harvard University Press, 2005) [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0097.html &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and immediately bought the film rights.&lt;ref name=Southern3&gt;Terry Southern,[http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/fall2004/line_items/strangelove.php &quot;Check-up with Dr. Strangelove&quot;], article written in 1963 for Esquire but unpublished at the time&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Schelling wrote that conversations between Kubrick, Schelling, and George in late 1960 about a treatment of ''Red Alert'' updated with intercontinental missiles eventually led to the making of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schelling |first=Thomas C. |year=2006 |title=Strategies of Commitment and Other Essays |url=https://archive.org/details/strategiesofcomm00sche |url-access=registration |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/strategiesofcomm00sche/page/212 212] |isbn=978-0-674-02567-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In collaboration with George, Kubrick started writing a screenplay based on the book. While writing the screenplay, they benefited from some brief consultations with Schelling and, later, [[Herman Kahn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghamari-Tabrizi&quot;&gt;Sharon Ghamari-Tabrizi, [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0097.html &quot;The Worlds of Herman Kahn; The Intuitive Science of Thermonuclear War&quot;], Harvard University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In following the tone of the book, Kubrick originally intended to film the story as a serious drama. However, as he later explained during interviews, he began to see comedy inherent in the idea of [[mutual assured destruction]] as he wrote the first draft. Kubrick said:{{quote|My idea of doing it as a nightmare comedy came in the early weeks of working on the screenplay. I found that in trying to put meat on the bones and to imagine the scenes fully, one had to keep leaving out of it things which were either absurd or paradoxical, in order to keep it from being funny; and these things seemed to be close to the heart of the scenes in question.&lt;ref&gt;''Macmillan International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers'', vol. 1, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Among the titles that Kubrick considered for the film were ''Dr. Doomsday or: How to Start World War III Without Even Trying'', ''Dr. Strangelove's Secret Uses of Uranus'', and ''Wonderful Bomb''.&lt;ref name=&quot;usher20120403&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.listsofnote.com/2012/04/dr-strangelove.html | title=Dr. Strangelove | work=Lists of Note | date=April 3, 2012 | accessdate=April 16, 2012 | author=Usher, Shaun}}&lt;/ref&gt; After deciding to make the film a black comedy, Kubrick brought in [[Terry Southern]] as a co-writer in late 1962. The choice was influenced by reading Southern's comic novel ''[[The Magic Christian (novel)|The Magic Christian]]'', which Kubrick had received as a gift from Peter Sellers,&lt;ref name=Southern&gt;Terry Southern, [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0081.html &quot;Notes from The War Room&quot;], ''Grand Street'', issue #49&lt;/ref&gt; and which itself became a Sellers film in 1969. Southern made important contributions to the film, but his role led to a rift between Kubrick and Peter George; after ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine published a photo-essay on Southern in August 1964 which implied that Southern had been the script's principal author—a misperception neither Kubrick nor Southern did much to dispel—Peter George wrote an indignant letter to the magazine, published in its September 1964 issue, in which he pointed out that he had both written the film's source novel and collaborated on various incarnations of the script over a period of ten months, whereas &quot;Southern was briefly employed ... to do some additional rewriting for Kubrick and myself and fittingly received a screenplay credit in {{em|third place}} behind Mr. Kubrick and myself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;George Case (2014), ''Calling Dr Strangelove: The Anatomy and Influence of the Kubrick Masterpiece'' (McFarland &amp; Co, Jefferson, Nth Carolina) p.118, {{ISBN|978-0-7864-9449-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sets and filming===
''Dr. Strangelove'' was filmed at [[Shepperton Studios]], near [[London]], as Sellers was in the middle of a divorce at the time and unable to leave England.&lt;ref name=interview69/&gt; The sets occupied three main [[sound stage]]s: the Pentagon War Room, the B-52 Stratofortress bomber and the last one containing both the motel room and General Ripper's office and outside corridor.&lt;ref name=Southern/&gt;  The studio's buildings were also used as the Air Force base exterior. The film's set design was done by [[Ken Adam]], the production designer of several [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' films]] (at the time he had already worked on ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''). The [[black and white]] cinematography was by [[Gilbert Taylor]], and the film was edited by [[Anthony Harvey]] and an uncredited Kubrick. The original musical score for the film was composed by [[Laurie Johnson]] and the special effects were by Wally Veevers. The theme of the chorus from the bomb run scene is a modification of ''[[When Johnny Comes Marching Home]]''. Sellers and Kubrick got on famously during the film's production and shared a love of photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Duncan, Paul|title=Stanley Kubrick: The Complete Films |publisher=Taschen GmbH|page=95|isbn=978-3-8365-2775-0|year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WarRoomModel.DrStrangelove.jpg|thumb|left|Model of the War Room constructed for the film.]]
[[File:Dr. Strangelove - The War Room.png|thumb|left|The War Room with the Big Board.]]

For the War Room, Ken Adam first designed a two-level set which Kubrick initially liked, only to decide later that it was not what he wanted. Adam next began work on the design that was used in the film, an [[expressionism|expressionist]] set that was compared with ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' and [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''. It was an enormous concrete room ({{convert|130|ft|m}} long and {{convert|100|ft|m}} wide, with a {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=on}}-high ceiling)&lt;ref name=Southern3/&gt; suggesting a bomb shelter, with a triangular shape (based on Kubrick's idea that this particular shape would prove the most resistant against an explosion). One side of the room was covered with gigantic strategic maps reflecting in a shiny black floor inspired by dance scenes in [[Fred Astaire]] films. In the middle of the room there was a large circular table lit from above by a circle of lamps, suggesting a poker table. Kubrick insisted that the table would be covered with green [[baize]] (although this could not be seen in the black and white film) to reinforce the actors' impression that they are playing 'a game of poker for the fate of the world.'&lt;ref name=Adam&gt;&quot;A Kubrick Masterclass,&quot; interview with Sir Ken Adam by Sir Christopher Frayling, 2005; excerpts from the interview were published online at [http://www.berlinale-talentcampus.de/www/73/viewentry/118 Berlinale talent capus] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125083244/http://www.berlinale-talentcampus.de/www/73/viewentry/118 |date=January 25, 2007 }} and the [http://www.scriptfactory.co.uk/go/WhatWeDo/Extract_285.html Script Factory website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929132220/http://www.scriptfactory.co.uk/go/WhatWeDo/Extract_285.html |date=September 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick asked Adam to build the set ceiling in [[concrete]] to force the director of photography to use only the on-set lights from the circle of lamps. Moreover, each lamp in the circle of lights was carefully placed and tested until Kubrick was happy with the result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0082.html Interview with Ken Adam by Michel Ciment], published in Michel Ciment, &quot;Kubrick,&quot; Holt, Rinehart, and Winston; 1st American ed edition (1983), {{ISBN|0-03-061687-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacking cooperation from [[United States Department of Defense|the Pentagon]] in the making of the film, the set designers reconstructed the aircraft cockpit to the best of their ability by comparing the cockpit of a [[B-29 Superfortress]] and a single photograph of the cockpit of a [[B-52]] and relating this to the geometry of the B-52's fuselage. The B-52 was state-of-the-art in the 1960s, and its cockpit was off-limits to the film crew. When some [[United States Air Force]] personnel were invited to view the reconstructed B-52 cockpit, they said that &quot;it was absolutely correct, even to the little black box which was the CRM.&quot;&lt;ref name=Inside/&gt; It was so accurate that Kubrick was concerned about whether Adam's team had carried out all its research legally.&lt;ref name=Inside/&gt;

In several shots of the B-52 flying over the polar ice en route to Russia, the shadow of the actual camera plane, a [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]], is visible on the icecap below. The B-52 was a scale model composited into the Arctic footage, which was sped up to create a sense of jet speed.&lt;ref&gt;The camera ship, a former USAAF B-17G-100-VE, serial 44-85643, registered F-BEEA, had been one of four Flying Fortresses purchased from salvage at [[Altus, Oklahoma]], in December 1947 by the French [[Institut géographique national (France)|Institut géographique national]] (IGN) and converted for surveying and photomapping work. It was the last active B-17 of a total of fourteen once flown by the IGN, but it was destroyed in a takeoff accident at [[RAF Binbrook]] in 1989 during making of the film ''[[Memphis Belle (film)|Memphis Belle]]''. {{Cite web|url=http://home.att.net/~jbaugher/1944_6.html |title=1944 USAAF Serial Numbers (44-83886 to 44-92098) |work=USAAS-USAAC-USAAF-USAF Aircraft Serial Numbers—1908 to Present |accessdate=May 4, 2007 |publisher=Joseph F.

In 1967, some of the flying footage from ''Dr Strangelove'' was re-used in [[The Beatles]]' television film ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]''. As told by editor Roy Benson in the [[BBC]] Radio Documentary ''Celluloid Beatles'', the production team of ''Magical Mystery Tour'' lacked footage to cover the sequence for the song &quot;[[Flying (Beatles instrumental)|Flying]]&quot;. Benson had access to the aerial footage filmed for the B52 sequences of ''Dr Strangelove'', which was stored at [[Shepperton Studios]]. The use of the footage prompted Kubrick to call Benson to complain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|last=Sugar|first=John (Producer)|title=Celluloid Beatles|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]|date=14 September 2013|access-date=22 August 2018|series=BBC Radio 4 Documentaries|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b039yp0f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Fail Safe''===
''Red Alert'' author [[Peter George (author)|Peter George]] collaborated on the screenplay with Kubrick and [[Satire|satirist]] [[Terry Southern]]. ''Red Alert'' was more solemn than its film version, and it did not include the character Dr. Strangelove, though the main plot and technical elements were quite similar. A [[novelization]] of the actual film, rather than a reprint of the original novel, was published by Peter George, based on an early draft in which the narrative is bookended by the account of aliens, who, having arrived at a desolated Earth, try to piece together what has happened. It was reissued in October 2015 by Candy Jar Books, featuring never-before-published material on Strangelove's early career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://candyjarlimited.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/v-behaviorurldefaultvmlo.html |title=Candy Jar Publishes Classic |accessdate=October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://candyjarlimited.blogspot.co.uk/search?updated-max=2015-09-30T13:38:00%2B01:00&amp;max-results=100 |title=DR STRANGELOVE—THE LOST STORY |website=candyjarlimited.blogspot.co.uk |accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the filming of ''Dr. Strangelove'', Stanley Kubrick learned that ''[[Fail Safe (1964 film)|Fail Safe]]'', a film with a similar theme, was being produced. Although ''Fail Safe'' was to be an ultrarealistic thriller, Kubrick feared that its plot resemblance would damage his film's box office potential, especially if it were released first. Indeed, the novel ''[[Fail-Safe (novel)|Fail-Safe]]'' (on which the film is based) is so similar to ''Red Alert'' that Peter George sued on charges of plagiarism and settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebookmall.com/ebook/72987-ebook.htm|title=Red Alert—Peter Bryant—Microsoft Reader eBook|accessdate=November 27, 2006|publisher=eBookMall, Inc.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225054/http://www.ebookmall.com/ebook/72987-ebook.htm|archivedate=September 27, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
What worried Kubrick the most was that ''Fail Safe'' boasted the acclaimed director [[Sidney Lumet]] and the first-rate dramatic actors [[Henry Fonda]] as the American president and [[Walter Matthau]] as the advisor to the Pentagon, Professor Groeteschele. Kubrick decided to throw a legal wrench into ''Fail Safe''{{'}}s production gears. Lumet recalled in the documentary ''Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove'': &quot;We started casting. Fonda was already set&amp;nbsp;... which of course meant a big commitment in terms of money. I was set, Walter [Bernstein, the screenwriter] was set&amp;nbsp;... And suddenly, this lawsuit arrived, filed by Stanley Kubrick and Columbia Pictures.&quot;

Kubrick argued that ''Fail Safe''{{'}}s own source novel ''Fail-Safe'' (1960) had been plagiarized from Peter George's ''Red Alert'', to which Kubrick owned creative rights. He pointed out unmistakable similarities in intentions between the characters Groeteschele and Strangelove. The plan worked, and ''Fail Safe'' opened eight months after ''Dr. Strangelove'', to critical acclaim but mediocre ticket sales.

===Ending===
The end of the film shows Dr. Strangelove exclaiming, &quot;''Mein Führer,'' I can walk!&quot; before cutting to footage of nuclear explosions, with [[Vera Lynn]] and her audience singing &quot;[[We'll Meet Again]]&quot;. This footage comes from nuclear tests such as shot BAKER of [[Operation Crossroads]] at [[Bikini Atoll]], the [[Trinity test]], a test from [[Operation Sandstone]] and the hydrogen bomb tests from [[Operation Redwing]] and [[Operation Ivy]]. In some shots, old warships (such as the German heavy cruiser ''[[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|Prinz Eugen]]''), which were used as targets, are plainly visible. In others, the smoke trails of rockets used to create a calibration backdrop can be seen.

Former ''[[The Goon Show|Goon Show]]'' writer and friend of Sellers [[Spike Milligan]] was credited with suggesting Vera Lynn's song for the ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reconstructing Strangelove : inside Stanley Kubrick's 'nightmare comedy'|last=Mick|first=Broderick|isbn=9780231177092|location=New York|oclc=966969835|date=2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original ending===
[[File:Pie Fight.jpg|thumb|The cream pie fight was removed from the final cut.]]

It was originally planned for the film to end with a scene that depicted everyone in the War Room involved in a [[pie fight]]. Accounts vary as to why the pie fight was cut. In a 1969 interview, Kubrick said, &quot;I decided it was [[farce]] and not consistent with the satiric tone of the rest of the film.&quot;&lt;ref name=interview69&gt;[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0069.html &quot;An Interview with Stanley Kubrick (1969)&quot;], published in Joseph Gelmis, ''The Film Director as Superstar'', 1970, Doubleday and Company: Garden City, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Alexander Walker (critic)|Alexander Walker]] observed that &quot;the cream pies were flying around so thickly that people lost definition, and you couldn't really say whom you were looking at.&quot;&lt;ref name=Inside/&gt;&lt;!-- 36m 09s --&gt; Nile Southern, son of screenwriter Terry Southern, suggested the fight was intended to be less jovial: &quot;Since they were laughing, it was unusable, because instead of having that totally black, which would have been amazing, like, this blizzard, which in a sense is metaphorical for all of the missiles that are coming, as well, you just have these guys having a good old time. So, as Kubrick later said, 'it was a disaster of [[Homer]]ic proportions.{{'&quot;}}&lt;ref name=Inside/&gt;&lt;!-- 35m 45s --&gt;

===Effects of the Kennedy assassination on the film===
A first test screening of the film was scheduled for November 22, 1963, the day of the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]]. The film was just weeks from its scheduled premiere, but because of the assassination, the release was delayed until late January 1964, as it was felt that the public was in no mood for such a film any sooner.&lt;ref name=&quot;George C. Scott bio&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheward|first1=David|title=Rage and Glory: The Volatile Life and Career of George C.

During post-production, one line by Slim Pickens, &quot;a fella could have a pretty good weekend in Dallas with all that stuff,&quot; was dubbed to change &quot;Dallas&quot; to &quot;[[Las Vegas|Vegas]],&quot; since Dallas was where Kennedy was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dallasnews.com/arts/arts/2014/01/19/dr.-strangeloves-deleted-dallas-reference-and-other-texas-ties|title='Dr. Strangelove's' deleted Dallas reference and other Texas ties|date=January 19, 2014|accessdate=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original reference to Dallas survives in the English audio of the French-subtitled version of the film.

The assassination also serves as another possible reason that the pie-fight scene was cut. In the scene, after Muffley takes a pie in the face, General Turgidson exclaims: &quot;Gentlemen! Our gallant young president has been struck down in his prime!&quot; Editor Anthony Harvey stated that the scene &quot;would have stayed, except that Columbia Pictures were horrified, and thought it would offend the president's family.&quot;&lt;ref name=NoFighting&gt;&quot;No Fighting in the War Room Or: Dr. Strangelove and the Nuclear Threat&quot;, a documentary included with the 40th Anniversary Special Edition DVD of the film&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick and others have said that the scene had already been cut before preview night because it was inconsistent with the rest of the film.&lt;ref name=Snider&gt;Eric D. Snider, &quot;[http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/movies/article/What-s-the-big-deal-Dr-Strangelove-1964-734814.php What's the big deal?: Dr. Strangelove (1964)]&quot;; ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', October 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rerelease in 1994===
In 1994, the film was rereleased. While the 1964 release used a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, the new print was in the slightly squarer 1.66:1 (5:3) ratio that Kubrick had originally intended.&lt;ref&gt;LoBrutto, Vincent. &quot;Stanley Kubrick: A Biography&quot;. Da Capo Press, 1995, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

===Satirizing the Cold War===
''Dr. Strangelove'' takes passing shots at numerous contemporary [[Cold War]] attitudes, such as the &quot;[[missile gap]]&quot;, but it primarily focuses its satire on the theory of [[mutual assured destruction]] (MAD),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The American cinema of excess: extremes of the national mind on film |last=King |first=Mike |authorlink= |year= 2009|publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=978-0-7864-3988-1 |page=46 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which each side is supposed to be deterred from a nuclear war by the prospect of a universal cataclysmic disaster regardless of who &quot;won&quot;. Military strategist and former physicist [[Herman Kahn]], in the book ''[[On Thermonuclear War]]'' (1960), used the theoretical example of a &quot;[[Doomsday device|doomsday machine]]&quot; to illustrate the limitations of MAD, which was developed by [[John von Neumann]].

The concept of such a machine is consistent with MAD doctrine when it is logically pursued to its conclusion. It thus worried Kahn that the military might like the idea of a doomsday machine and build one.&lt;ref&gt;''On Thermonuclear War'' pp. 144–155&lt;/ref&gt; Kahn, a leading critic of MAD and [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower's administration]]'s doctrine of [[massive retaliation]] upon the slightest provocation by the USSR, considered MAD to be foolish bravado, and urged America to instead plan for [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]], and thus even a limited nuclear war. With this logical reasoning, Kahn became one of the architects of the [[flexible response]] doctrine, which, while superficially resembling MAD, allowed for responding to a limited nuclear strike with a proportional, or calibrated, return of fire (see ''[[On Escalation]]'').

Kahn educated Kubrick on the concept of the semirealistic [[cobalt bomb|&quot;cobalt-thorium G&quot;]] doomsday machine, and then Kubrick used the concept for the film. Kahn in his writings and talks would often come across as cold and calculating, for example, with his use of the term &quot;[[megadeath]]s&quot; and in his willingness to estimate how many human lives the United States could lose and still rebuild economically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy, Volume 1 |last= |first= |authorlink= |vauthors= |year=2001 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location= |isbn=978-0-684-80657-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofam03deco/page/471 471] |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofam03deco/page/471 |accessdate= |url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahn's cold analytical attitude towards millions of deaths is reflected in Turgidson's remark to the president about the outcome of a preemptive nuclear war: &quot;Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed. But I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops, uh, depending on the breaks.&quot; Turgidson has a binder that is labelled &quot;World Targets in Megadeaths&quot;, a term coined in 1953 by Kahn and popularized in his 1960 book ''On Thermonuclear War''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The age of radiance : the epic rise and dramatic fall of the atomic era|last=Craig|first=Nelson|year=2014|isbn=978-1451660432|pages=290, 291|oclc=852226548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[wikt:post hoc|post-hoc]] planning in the film, by Dr. Strangelove, done {{em|after}} the MAD policy has clearly broken down, to keep the human race alive and to regenerate from populations sheltered in [[mineshaft]]s, is a parody of those strict adherents of the MAD doctrine who are opposed to the prior creation of [[fallout shelter]]s on ideological grounds. To such adherents, talk of survival takes the &quot;Assured Destruction&quot; out of &quot;Mutual Assured Destruction&quot;, hence no preparations should be conducted for fear of &quot;destabilizing&quot; the MAD doctrine. Moreover, it is also somewhat of a parody of [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Edward Teller]], Herman Kahn, and [[Chet Holifield]]'s November 1961 popularization of a similar plan to spend billions of dollars on a nationwide network of [[radiation shielding|highly protective]] concrete-lined underground fallout shelters, capable of holding millions of people and to be built {{em|before}} any such nuclear exchange began.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine November 1961 pages 112–115 et al.&lt;/ref&gt; These extensive and therefore wildly expensive preparations were the fullest conceivable implementation of [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]]'s, month prior, September 1961 advocacy in favor of the comparatively more modest, individual and community [[fallout shelter]]s, as it appeared in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.em.doe.gov/Publications/timeline_sep1961.aspx|title=Office of Environmental Management - Department of Energy|website=www.em.doe.gov|accessdate=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was in the context of [[The Shelter (The Twilight Zone)#Context|shelters being on the minds of the public at the time]] due to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961|Berlin Crisis]]. The Kennedy administration would later go on to expand the nascent [[United States civil defense]] efforts, including the [[Duck and cover#Delayed nuclear radiation, &quot;fallout&quot;|assessment of millions of homes]] and to create a network of thousands of well known, black and yellow plaqued, community fallout shelters. This was done, not with a massive construction effort but by the relatively cheap re-purposing of existing buildings and stocking them with [[CD V-700|CD V-700 geiger counters]] etc. In 1962 the Kennedy administration would found the [[American Civil Defense Association]] to organize this, comparatively far more [[Civil defense#Atomic Age|cost-effective, shelter effort]].

The fallout-shelter-network proposal, mentioned in the film, with its inherently high [[radiation protection]] characteristics, has similarities and contrasts to that of the very real and robust [[Military of Switzerland#Military and civil defence|Swiss civil defense]] network. Switzerland has an overcapacity of nuclear fallout shelters for the country's population size, and by law, new homes must still be built with a fallout shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304231204576405700994655570 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Deborah | last=Ball | title=Swiss Renew Push for Bomb Shelters | date=June 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6347519.stm | work=BBC News | first=Imogen | last=Foulkes | title=Swiss still braced for nuclear war | date=February 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the US did that, it would violate the spirit of MAD and according to MAD adherents, allegedly destabilize the situation because the US could launch a [[first strike]] and its population would largely survive a retaliatory second strike (see [[Mutual assured destruction#Theory|MAD § Theory]]).

To refute early 1960s novels and Hollywood films like ''Fail-Safe'' and ''Dr. Strangelove'', which raised questions about US control over nuclear weapons, the Air Force produced a documentary film, ''SAC Command Post'', to demonstrate its responsiveness to presidential command and its tight control over nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb304/film03.htm SAC Command Post]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, later academic research into declassified documents showed that U.S. military commanders had been given presidentially-authorized pre-delegation for the use of nuclear weapons during the early Cold War, showing that that aspect of the film's plot was plausible.&lt;ref name=diplomat-20180105&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://thediplomat.com/2018/01/dr-strangelove-and-the-insane-reality-of-nuclear-command-and-control/ |title=Dr. Strangelove and the Insane Reality of Nuclear Command-and-Control |last=Gady |first=Franz-Stefan |magazine=The Diplomat |date=5 January 2018 |accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characters of Buck Turgidson and Jack Ripper both deride the real-life Gen. [[Curtis LeMay]] of the [[Strategic Air Command]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~dlindley/handouts/strangelovenotes.html|title=A Teaching Guide to Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove |author=Dan Lindley |date=8 September 2009 |publisher=www3.nd.edu|access-date=2 December 2018 |quote=Ripper: 'He said war was too important to be left to the Generals. When he said that, fifty years ago, he might have been right. But today, war is too important to be left to politicians. They have neither the time, the training, nor the inclination for strategic thought'. Air Force Lieutenant General David Burchinal (U.S.A.F. Chief of Staff LeMay's deputy for operations), speaks about the Cuban Missile Crisis and the value of strategic superiority: 'They did not understand what had been created and handed to them'. To which LeMay confirmed: 'That was the mood prevalent with the top civilian leadership you are quite correct'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual themes===
In the months following the film's release director Stanley Kubrick received a fan letter from Legrace G. Benson of the Department of History of Art at [[Cornell University]] interpreting the film as being sexually-layered. The director wrote back to Benson and confirmed the interpretation, &quot;Seriously, you are the first one who seems to have noticed the sexual framework from intromission (the planes going in) to the last spasm (Kong's ride down and detonation at target).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Castle |first1=Alison |title=The Stanley Kubrick Archives |year=2008 |publisher=Taschen |isbn=978-3836508889 |page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual metaphors often popped up when the nuclear analysts that Kubrick consulted were discussing strategy, such as when [[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]] compared his not attacking cities/withhold plan following belligerent escalation to [[coitus interruptus]] in an internally circulated [[memorandum]] at the [[RAND Corporation]] (spoofed in the film as the &quot;BLAND Corporation&quot;), while he described the [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]] plan of [[massive retaliation]] as &quot;going all the way&quot;. That led RAND scholar Herman Kahn, whom Kubrick consulted, to quip to an assembled group of &quot;massive retaliation&quot; SAC officers, &quot;Gentlemen, you do not have a [[war plan]]. You have a [[Schlesinger Doctrine#Wargasm|Wargasm!]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Fred ''The Wizards of Armageddon''. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1991, 222–223&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
===Box office===
The film was a popular success, earning [[US$]]4,420,000 in rentals in North America during its initial theatrical release.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Big Rental Pictures of 1964&quot;, ''Variety'', January 6, 1965 p 39. Note this figure is rentals accruing to distributors, not total gross.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
''Dr. Strangelove'' is Kubrick's highest rated film on [[Rotten Tomatoes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/stanley_kubrick/ |title = STANLEY KUBRICK |accessdate = November 30, 2016 | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher = Flixster  }}&lt;/ref&gt; holding a 98% approval rating based on 83 reviews, with an average rating of 9.14/10. The site's critical consensus reads, &quot;Stanley Kubrick's brilliant Cold War satire remains as funny and razor-sharp today as it was in 1964.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dr_strangelove/ |title = Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) |accessdate = July 17, 2019 | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher = [[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also holds a score of 96 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]], based on 11 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. The film is ranked number 7 in the All-Time High Scores chart of Metacritic's Video/DVD section.&lt;ref name=metacritic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/highscores.shtml |title=DVD/Video: All-Time High Scores | website = Metacritic |accessdate=August 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].

''Dr. Strangelove'' is on [[Roger Ebert]]'s list of ''[[The Great Movies]]'',&lt;ref name=Ebert&gt;Roger Ebert, [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990711/REVIEWS08/907110301/1023 &quot;Dr. Strangelove (1964)&quot;], July 11, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and he described it as &quot;arguably the best political satire of the century&quot;. One of the most celebrated of all film comedies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/378353/gentlemen-you-cant-fight-war-room-michael-potemra |title=Gentlemen!

All the gods before whom the America of the stolid, paranoid 50s had genuflected—the Bomb, the Pentagon, the National Security State, the President himself, Texan masculinity and the alleged Commie menace of water-fluoridation—went into the wood-chipper and never got the same respect ever again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/18/dr-strangelove-kubrick-comedy |title=Dr Strangelove: No 6 best comedy film of all time |last=Patterson |first=John |newspaper=The Guardian|date=October 18, 2010 |accessdate=December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also listed as number 26 on ''[[Empire (magazine)#Current List, The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time|Empire's 500 Greatest Movies of All Time]]'', and in 2010 it was listed by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine as one of the 100 best films since the publication's inception in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2005/02/12/all-time-100-movies/slide/dr-strangelove-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-bomb-1964/ |title=Dr. Strangelove: or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb |last=Schickel |first=Richard |magazine=Time |date=January 13, 2010 |accessdate=December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Writers Guild of America, West|Writers Guild of America]] ranked its screenplay the 12th best ever written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.org/writers-room/101-best-lists/101-greatest-screenplays/list |title=101 Greatest Screenplays |publisher=Writers Guild of America, West |accessdate=December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, readers of ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine voted it the 24th greatest comedic film of all time.

==Potential sequel==
In 1995, Kubrick enlisted [[Terry Southern]] to script a sequel titled ''Son of Strangelove''. Kubrick had [[Terry Gilliam]] in mind to direct. The script was never completed, but index cards laying out the story's basic structure were found among Southern's papers after he died in October 1995. It was set largely in underground bunkers, where Dr. Strangelove had taken refuge with a group of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/trivia-stanley-kubrick-wanted-terry-gilliam-to-make-a-dr-strangelove-sequel/|title=Trivia: Terry Gilliam Says Stanley Kubrick Wanted Him to Make a ‘Dr. Strangelove’ Sequel|date=2013-10-16|website=/Film|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Gilliam commented, &quot;I was told after Kubrick died—by someone who had been dealing with him—that he had been interested in trying to do another ''Strangelove'' with me directing. I never knew about that until after he died but I would have loved to.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2013/10/stanley-kubrick-wanted-terry-gilliam-to-direct-son-of-strangelove.html|title=Stanley Kubrick Wanted Terry Gilliam To Direct SON OF STRANGELOVE|last=Brown|first=Todd|publisher=[[Twitch Film]]|date=October 12, 2013|accessdate=October 13, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013215342/http://twitchfilm.com/2013/10/stanley-kubrick-wanted-terry-gilliam-to-direct-son-of-strangelove.html|archivedate=October 13, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
