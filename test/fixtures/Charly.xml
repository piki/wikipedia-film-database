'''''Charly''''' (marketed and stylized as '''''CHAЯLY''''') is a 1968 American [[Drama (modern genre)|drama film]], directed and produced by [[Ralph Nelson]], and written by [[Stirling Silliphant]]. It was based on ''[[Flowers for Algernon]],'' a science fiction short story (1958) and subsequent novel (1966) by [[Daniel Keyes]].

The film stars [[Cliff Robertson]] as Charly Gordon, an [[Intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] adult who is selected by two doctors to undergo a surgical procedure that triples his IQ as it did for Algernon, a laboratory mouse who also underwent the same procedure; additional roles are co-played by [[Claire Bloom]], [[Lilia Skala]], [[Leon Janney]], and [[Dick Van Patten]].  Robertson was reprising his previous portrayal of the same role in a 1961 television adaptation, &quot;The Two Worlds of Charlie Gordon&quot;, an episode of the anthology series ''[[The United States Steel Hour]]''.

The film received positive reviews, and was a success at the box office and, a generation later, in home media sales.

== Plot ==

Charly Gordon ([[Cliff Robertson]]), an intellectually disabled man with a strong desire to make himself smarter, has been attending night school for two years where he has been taught by Alice Kinnian ([[Claire Bloom]]) to read and write. However, his spelling remains poor and he is even unable to spell his own name.

Alice takes Charly to a clinic run by Dr. Richard Nemur and Dr. Anna Straus&lt;!-- &quot;Straus&quot; is the spelling used in the film, and is different from the book --&gt;. Nemur and Straus have been increasing the intelligence of laboratory mice with a new surgical procedure and are looking for a human test subject. As part of a series of tests to ascertain Charly's suitability for the procedure, he is made to race Algernon, one of the laboratory mice. Algernon physically runs through a maze while Charly uses a pencil to trace his way through a diagram of the same maze. Charly is disappointed that he consistently loses the races. Nevertheless, he is given the experimental surgery.

After the surgery, Charly is initially angered that he is not immediately smarter than he was before and still loses in races against Algernon. Eventually, however, he beats Algernon in a race and then his intelligence starts increasing rapidly. Alice continues to teach him, but he soon surpasses her. Charly's co-workers also try to tease him by making him work on a machine that they believe he will not be able to work. When Charly shows he can work the machine, his co-workers are not pleased with the fact that he is now intelligent and cannot be teased anymore. They sign a petition against him and he loses his job at the bakery. Charly also starts staring at Alice's body as well as drawing and painting abstract nude figures of her. He also questions whether Alice loves her fiancé. One night, Charly follows Alice back to her apartment and [[sexual assault|sexually assaults]] her, pulling her to the floor and kissing her forcefully until she breaks free by slapping him.

The film then uses a [[montage sequence]] to show Charly &amp;ndash; having escaped into the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] &amp;ndash; wearing a mustache and [[goatee]], riding a motorcycle, kissing a series of different women, smoking and dancing. At the end of the sequence, Charly has returned home and Alice comes to visit him, both having learned during their time apart that they want to be together. A further montage sequence shows Charly and Alice running through woods and kissing under trees accompanied by a [[voice-over]] of the two of them talking about marriage.

Straus and Nemur present their research to a panel of scientists, including a question-and-answer session with Charly. Charly is aggressive during the session and then reveals that Algernon has just died, causing Charly to believe that his own increased intelligence is only temporary. After suffering visions of his intelligence fading and of his pre-operative self following him, Charly decides to work with Nemur and Straus to see if he can be saved. Charly discovers that there is nothing that can be done to prevent his own intelligence from fading. Alice visits Charly and asks him to marry her, but he refuses and tells her to leave.

In the film's final scene, Alice watches Charly playing with children in a playground, having reverted to his former self.

The short story ''[[Flowers for Algernon]]'' had previously been the basis of &quot;The Two Worlds of Charlie Gordon&quot;, a 1961 television adaptation in which Robertson had also starred for [[CBS]]'s ''[[The United States Steel Hour|U. S. Steel Hour]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Charly (1968): Notes | url= http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/22803/Charly/notes.html | publisher= [[Turner Classic Movies]] | accessdate=2011-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson had starred in a number of TV shows which were turned into films with other actors playing his role, such as ''[[Days of Wine and Roses (1958 TV drama)|Days of Wine and Roses]]''. He bought the rights to the story, hoping to star in the film version as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Karen |first=Zraick |title=Oscar-winner Cliff Robertson dies in US at 88 |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g_vP2gIpcUU3NA8YrU1rBcURyVsQ?docId=8b801a15cf2b4089a0ba17c4f4379fef |accessdate=September 12, 2011 |newspaper=Associated Press |date=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He originally hired [[William Goldman]] to write the screenplay on the strength of Goldman's novel ''[[No Way to Treat a Lady (film)#Original Novel|No Way to Treat a Lady]]'', paying him $30,000 out of his own pocket.&lt;ref name=&quot;shop&quot;&gt;Dennis Brown, ''Shoptalk'', Newmarket Press, 1992 p 63&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson was unhappy with Goldman's work and then hired Stirling Silliphant to do a draft.&lt;ref&gt;William Goldman, ''Adventures in the Screen Trade'', 1982 p 164-176&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson did the role for only $25,000.&lt;ref&gt;No Flap Over Oscar Absence--Robertson

==Box office==
The film was a hit, earning $7.25&amp;nbsp;million in [[Gross rental|theatrical rentals]] during its release in North America, and it earned an additional $1.25&amp;nbsp;million in [[Gross rental|theatrical rentals]] overseas, making it the [[1968 in film|16th-highest-grossing film of 1968]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.listal.com/list/top-grossing-films-1968 | title=Top Grossing Films of 1968 | publisher=Listal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After all costs were deducted (including $1,325,000 paid to profit share), the film reported a profit of $1,390,000, making it one of the most successful movies ever made by [[ABC Motion Pictures]].&lt;ref name=&quot;variety&quot;/&gt;

== Critical reception ==

[[Vincent Canby]] called the film a &quot;self-conscious contemporary drama, the first ever to exploit mental retardation for... the bittersweet romance of it&quot;; he called Robertson's performance &quot;earnest&quot; but points out that &quot;we [the audience] are forced into the vaguely unpleasant position of being voyeurs, congratulating ourselves for not being Charly as often as we feel a distant pity for him.&quot; Canby calls Nelson's direction &quot;neo-[[Expo 67]]&quot;, referring to the use of [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split screen]] to &quot;show simultaneously the reactions of two people facing each other and conversing&quot; and the use of &quot;little postage stamp-sized inserts of images within the larger screen frame.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= The Screen: Cliff Robertson in Title Role of ''Charly''| publisher= [[The New York Times]] | url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E03E1D61339E433A05757C2A96F9C946991D6CF | date= September 24, 1968| author=[[Vincent Canby]] | accessdate=2011-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called ''Charly'' an &quot;odd little movie about mental retardation and the dangers of all-conquering science, done with a dash of whimsy.&quot; While &quot;the historic sights in and around Charly's [[Boston]] setting have never been more lovingly filmed&quot;, &quot;The impact of [Robertson's] performance...is lessened by Producer-Director Ralph Nelson's determination to prove that he learned how to be new and now at Expo '67: almost every other sequence is done in split screens, multiple images, still shots or slow motion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Cinema: Medical Menace | publisher= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902474,00.html | date= October 18, 1968 | accessdate=2011-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screenwriter (and [[Hollywood blacklist]] target&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/18/arts/maurice-rapf-88-screenwriter-and-film-professor.html | work=The New York Times | title=Maurice Rapf, 88, Screenwriter and Film Professor | date=April 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;) [[Maurice Rapf]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0710683/]&lt;/ref&gt; called Robertson's performance &quot;extraordinary&quot; and called &quot;astonishing&quot; his on-screen &quot;transformation from one end of the intellectual spectrum to the other&quot;; Rapf took issue with what he called the &quot;pyrotechnics of the camera&quot; and the &quot;flashy opticals&quot;, calling the effects &quot;jarringly out of place&quot; and better suited for a &quot;no-story [[mod (subculture)|mod]] film like ''[[The Knack ...and How to Get It|The Knack]]''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Is ''Charly'' Cuter Than Necessary? | publisher= [[Life (magazine)|Life]] | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FUkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA12 | date= November 1, 1968| author= Maurice Rapf |accessdate=2011-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three stars out of four, saying &quot;The relationship between Charly (Cliff Robertson) and the girl (Claire Bloom) is handled delicately and well. She cares for him, but inadequately understands the problems he's facing. These become more serious when he passes normal IQ and moves into the genius category; his emotional development falls behind. It is this story, involving a personal crisis, which makes ''Charly'' a warm and rewarding film.&quot; By contrast, Ebert pointed out &quot;the whole scientific [[Hocus Pocus (magic)|hocus-pocus]], which causes his crisis, is irrelevant and weakens the movie by distracting us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Charly| publisher= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19681231/REVIEWS/812310301/1023 | date= December 31, 1968 | author=[[Roger Ebert]] | accessdate=2011-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' listed ''Charly'' among its &quot;25 Best Movie Tearjerkers Ever.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20049041_20073910,00.html | title= 25 Best Movie Tearjerkers Ever| publisher= [[Entertainment Weekly]] | accessdate=2011-03-25| date=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==

At the [[National Board of Review Awards 1968|40th National Board of Review Awards]], ''Charly'' was fourth in their list of &quot;Top Ten Films&quot; of 1968, and Cliff Robertson was chosen the year's &quot;Best Actor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.nbrmp.org/awards/past.cfm?year=1968 | title= Awards for 1968 | publisher= [[National Board of Review]] | accessdate= 2011-03-25 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101125221611/http://nbrmp.org/awards/past.cfm?year=1968 | archivedate= November 25, 2010 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[41st Academy Awards]], Robertson won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role]], under some controversy: less than two weeks after the ceremony, ''Time'' magazine mentioned the Academy's generalized concerns over &quot;excessive and vulgar solicitation of votes&quot; and said &quot;many members agreed that Robertson's award was based more on promotion than on performance. &quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= The Trade: Grand Illusion | publisher= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | url= http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,840086,00.html | date= April 25, 1969| accessdate= 2011-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was nominated for a [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]], losing to ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1969-hugo-awards/ | title= 1969 Hugo Awards | publisher= [[World Science Fiction Society]]| accessdate=2011-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposed sequel ==

In the late 1970s, following a period of extended unemployment that followed an act of [[whistleblower|whistle-blowing]] against [[David Begelman]], the then-president of Columbia Pictures, Robertson wrote and attempted to produce ''Charly II'', to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Michelle Green |date= December 5, 1983 |title= Hollywood's Mr. Clean Shot Down David Begelman; Now the Actor Has Pulled His Career Out of a Nose Dive |journal= [[People (magazine)|People]] |url= http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20086490,00.html |volume= 20 |issue=23 |publisher= [[Time Inc.]] |accessdate=2011-03-25 | quote= Hoping to capitalize on his 1968 Oscar-winning role in ''Charly'', playing a mentally retarded man who becomes, briefly, a genius, he wrote and began peddling ''Charly II'', only to have the film's backers pull out.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
