'''''Hercules: The Legendary Journeys''''' is an American [[Television program|television series]] filmed in [[New Zealand]], based on the tales of the classical [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[culture hero]] [[Heracles]] ([[Hercules]] was his Roman analogue). It was produced from January 16, 1995 to November 22, 1999. It ran for six seasons, producing action figures and other memorabilia as it became one of the highest rated syndicated television shows in the world at that time, and aired on [[Canal Once (Mexico)|Once Channel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bookrags Research&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/hercules-the-legendary-journeys-sjpc-02/ |title=Research Hercules: the Legendary Journeys |publisher=BookRags.com |date=2010-11-02 |accessdate=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, on the UK, it finally aired on [[Sky1]] as possibly, and aired on [[Channel Five (UK)|five/5]] and on [[Horror Channel|Horror]].

It was preceded by several TV movies with the same major characters in 1994 as part of [[Universal Television]]'s [[Action Pack (television)|Action Pack]] in order of appearance: ''[[Hercules and the Amazon Women]]'', ''[[Hercules and the Lost Kingdom]]'', ''[[Hercules and the Circle of Fire]]'', ''[[Hercules in the Underworld]]'', and ''[[Hercules in the Maze of the Minotaur]]'', the last of which served mostly as a &quot;[[clip show]]&quot; of the previous movies as a lead up to the series. The show was cancelled midway through filming of the sixth season, and only a total of eight episodes were produced after Kevin Sorbo initially declined to renew a three-year extension contract to continue his role as Hercules.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin Sorbo Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thescifiworld.net/interviews/kevin_sorbo_01.htm |title=Kevin Sorbo interview |date=2007-10-09 |accessdate=2015-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[Image:Hercules Iolaus.jpg|alt=Two men, the one on the left has long brown hair and is taller than the one on the right. The man on the right has long blond hair and is wearing a tunic top and leather trousers and a gauntlet on his right arm. The man on the right is wearing a waistcoat, leather trousers and a medallion around his neck.|thumb|left|Kevin Sorbo as Hercules (left) and Michael Hurst as Iolaus (right)]]
The series is set in a [[fantasy]] version of [[ancient Greece]] not precisely located in historical time. Although set in ancient Greece, the show also has a mixture of [[Orient]]al, [[Egypt]]ian and [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] elements in various episodes. The show stars [[Kevin Sorbo]] as Hercules and regularly features [[Michael Hurst]] as his sidekick [[Iolaus]]. Rotating as Hercules' other regular companion, particularly in earlier seasons, is Salmoneus ([[Robert Trebor]]), a wheeler-dealer ever looking to make a quick dinar.

Typical plot lines involve Hercules and Iolaus saving rustic villagers from monsters, evil warlords, or the often selfish whims of the gods. There was also comedy and episodes often had &quot;in-jokes&quot; about modern themes.

In the earlier episodes as mentioned in the show's opening title, Hercules' main nemesis is his [[evil]] stepmother [[Hera]], the powerful queen of the gods who seeks to destroy Hercules using various monsters and helping her various followers because he is a reminder of her husband Zeus' infidelity. As the series progressed, a wider range of enemies was used; notably Hercules' half-brother, the malicious god of war [[Ares (Hercules and Xena)|Ares]] replaced Hera as the show's primary [[antagonist]]. Towards the end of the series, Ares is himself replaced by the evil god [[List of Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess characters#Other Gods|Dahak]] who is the main villain in the show's fifth season and sets off a story arc that has Hercules traveling to [[Sumer]]ia, [[Scandinavia|Norseland]] and [[Éire]]. Although Zeus, Hercules' father, is frequently cited by Hercules as a neglectful father, Zeus' love for Hercules is well documented in the show. Indeed, Hercules is often referred to as &quot;the favorite son of Zeus&quot;. Zeus makes several appearances on the show, even saving his son's life and restoring his superhuman strength on one occasion when he needs it the most. Hercules, for his own part, is always there for Zeus when his father needs him, and in the end, Hercules reconciles with his father and buries whatever issues he has with the father he has come to understand and love.
