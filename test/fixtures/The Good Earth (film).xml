'''''The Good Earth''''' is a [[1937 in film|1937]] American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] about Chinese farmers who struggle to survive. It was adapted by [[Talbot Jennings]], [[Tess Slesinger]], and [[Claudine West]] from the play by [[Owen Davis]] and [[Donald Davis (writer)|Donald Davis]], which was in itself based on the 1931 [[The Good Earth|novel of the same name]] by [[Nobel Prize]]-winning author [[Pearl S. Buck]]. The film was directed by [[Sidney Franklin (director)|Sidney Franklin]], with uncredited contributions by [[Victor Fleming]] and [[Gustav Machaty]].

The film stars [[Paul Muni]] as Wang Lung. For her role as his wife O-Lan, [[Luise Rainer]] won an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. The film also won the [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]] for [[Karl Freund]].  It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. Its [[world premiere]] was at the elegant [[Carthay Circle Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]].

==Plot==
In pre-[[World War I]] northern China, young farmer Wang Lung ([[Paul Muni]]) marries O-Lan ([[Luise Rainer]]), a slave at the Great House, the residence of the most powerful family in their village. O-Lan proves to be an excellent wife, hard working and uncomplaining. Wang Lung prospers. He buys more land, and O-Lan gives birth to two sons and a daughter. Meanwhile, the Great House begins to decline.

All is well until a drought and the resulting famine drive the family to the brink. O-Lan gives birth to a second daughter but kills her shortly after birth to spare her from starvation. Desperate, Wang Lung considers the advice of his pessimistic, worthless uncle ([[Walter Connolly]]) to sell his land for food, but O-Lan opposes it. Instead, they travel south to a city in search of work. The family survives by begging and stealing. When a revolutionary gives a speech to try to drum up support for the army approaching despite rain in the north, Wang Lung and O-Lan realize the drought is over. They long to return to their farm, but they have no money for an ox, seed, and food.

The city changes hands, and O-Lan joins a mob looting a mansion. However, she is knocked down and trampled upon. When she comes to, she finds a bag of jewels overlooked in the confusion. This windfall allows the family to go home and prosper once more. O-Lan asks only to keep two pearls for herself.

Years pass. Wang Lung's sons grow up into educated young men, and he has grown so wealthy that he purchases the Great House. Then, Wang Lung becomes besotted with Lotus ([[Tilly Losch]]), a pretty, young dancer at the local [[tea house]], and makes her his second wife. He begins to find fault with the worn-out O-Lan. Desperate to gain affection from Lotus, he gives O-Lan's pearls to Lotus.

When Wang Lung discovers that Lotus has seduced Younger Son ([[Roland Lui]]), he orders his son to leave. Then a swarm of [[locust]]s threatens the entire village. Using a strategy devised by Elder Son ([[Keye Luke]]), everyone unites to try to save the crops. Just when all seems lost, the wind shifts direction, taking the danger away. The near-disaster brings Wang Lung back to his senses. He reconciles with Younger Son. On the latter's wedding day, Wang Lung returns the pearls to O-Lan before she dies, completely exhausted by a hard life.  Without disturbing the wedding festivities, Wang Lung quietly exits the house and regards a flowering peach tree planted by O-Lan on their marriage day.  Reverently he murmurs, &quot;O-Lan, you are the earth.&quot;

==Production==
The film's budget was $2.8 million, a small fortune at the time, and took three years to make. A five-hundred-acre farm in [[Porter Ranch, Los Angeles, California|Porter Ranch, California]], was transformed into a replica of Chinese farmland for this film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roar140&quot;&gt;{{citation

The movie script was more sympathetic to China than the novel had been. Wang Lung's son was now a representative of modern China who goes to university and leads the villagers. The family is a wholesome affectionate unit, even the uncle who in the novel exploits Wang Lung, and the sexual aspect of Lotus is played down. The [[Motion Picture Production Code|Hays office]], which supervised each Hollywood script, demanded more than twenty rewrites to eliminate what it found offensive.&lt;ref&gt;Hoban, James L., Jr., “Scripting The Good Earth: Versions of the Novel for the Screen,” in Elizabeth Johnston Lipscomb, Frances E. Webb, Peter J. Conn, eds., ''The Several Worlds of Pearl S. Buck'' (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Before Herbert Stothart and Edward Ward were engaged to provide the music, negotiations took place with Austrian composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]], who is known to have made some musical sketches for the score before the plan fell through.

Pearl Buck intended the film to be cast with all Chinese or Chinese-American actors. [[Irving Thalberg]] also envisioned casting only Chinese actors, but had to concede that American audiences were not ready for such a film. Though [[Anna May Wong]] had been suggested for the role of O-Lan, the [[Hays Code]] anti-[[miscegenation]] rules required Paul Muni's character's wife to be played by a white actress.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, Graham Russell. ''Anna May Wong: From Laundryman's Daughter to Hollywood Legend'' (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004), 44, 148, 60–67.&lt;/ref&gt; MGM offered Wong the role of Lotus, but she refused, stating, &quot;You're asking me – with Chinese blood – to do the only unsympathetic role in the picture featuring an all-American cast portraying Chinese  characters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/article@apa?profile_of_anna_may_wong_remembering_the_silent_star_9144.aspx | title= Profile of Anna May Wong: Remembering The Silent Star | first= Kenneth |last= Quan | date= 9 January 2004 | work= Asia Pacific Arts | publisher= University of Southern California |accessdate= 12 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the characters were played by [[yellowface|Western actors made to look Asian]] with aid of make-up techniques developed by [[Jack Dawn]] and used for the first time in this film.  However, some of the supporting cast did include Chinese American actors.

When MGM inquired into the possibility of making the film in China, the Chinese government was divided on how to respond. Initial hostility derived from resentment of the novel, which critics charged focused only on the perceived backwardness of the country while some government officials hoped to have control which would be gone if the film work was done outside China. Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] himself intervened, perhaps at the behest of his wife, [[Soong Mei-ling|Mme. Chiang]], whose American education made her an advocate for cooperation. Permission was granted on condition that the view of China be favorable, that Chinese government would supervise and have approval of shots done in China, and the unenforced stipulation that the entire cast be Chinese. The government in Nanjing did not foresee the sympathy the film would create and when MGM decided to shoot on location in China officials took extraordinary steps to control the production, forcing the studio to hire a Nationalist general to advise them on authentic settings and costumes (most of this footage was mysteriously lost when it was shipped home and had to be re-shot in California). There were reports that MGM distributed a different version of the film in China &lt;ref&gt;Zhiwei Xiao,  “Nationalism, Orientalism, and an Unequal Treatise of Ethnography: The Making of ''The Good Earth'',”  in Suzie Lan Cassell, ed., ''From Gold Mountain to the New World: Chinese American Studies in the New Millennium'' (Alta Mira, 2002), pp. 277–79, 283–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's 1936 production lasted from February 28 to July 23. Thalberg died on September 14, four-and-a-half months before its [[Los Angeles]] premiere on January 29, 1937. The film credits stated that this was his &quot;last great achievement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hay, Peter. ''MGM: When the Lion Roars''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Contemporary reviews were positive. [[Frank Nugent|Frank S. Nugent]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the film as &quot;a superb translation of a literary classic ... one of the finest things Hollywood has done this season or any other. While it has taken some liberties with the novel's text, it has taken none with its quality or spirit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173FE464BC4B53DFB466838C629EDE |title=Movie Review - The Good Earth |last=Nugent |first=Frank S. |authorlink=Frank  Nugent |date=February 3, 1937 |website=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |accessdate=August 31, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' declared it &quot;a remarkable screen production&quot; and called Muni's performance &quot;splendid&quot;, but questioned whether the subject matter would make for good box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=February 10, 1937 |title=Film Reviews |url= |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |location=New York |publisher=Variety, Inc. |page=14 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Film Daily]]'' raved, &quot;A 'must see' picture, possessing absorbing drama, passionate sincerity and brilliant performance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |date=February 3, 1937 |title=Reviews of the New Films |url= |journal=[[Film Daily]] |location=New York |publisher=Wid's Films and Film Folk, Inc. |page=9 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Mosher (writer)|John Mosher]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' called it &quot;a vast and rich film.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=February 6, 1937 |title=The Current Cinema |url= |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |location=New York |publisher=F-R Publishing Corp. |page=59 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' described it as &quot;a highly artistic piece of work,&quot; and while not exactly an entertaining picture, &quot;those who see it will undoubtedly be awed by its magnificence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |date=February 13, 1937 |title=The Good Earth |url= |journal=[[Harrison's Reports]] |location=New York |publisher=Harrison's Reports, Inc. |page=3 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Box office==
According to MGM records the film earned $2,002,000 in the US and Canada and $1,555,000 elsewhere but because of its high cost incurred an ultimate loss of $96,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mannix&quot;/&gt;
