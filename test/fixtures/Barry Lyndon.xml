'''''Barry Lyndon''''' is a 1975 [[Period film|period]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written, directed and produced by [[Stanley Kubrick]], based on the 1844 novel ''[[The Luck of Barry Lyndon]]'' by [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]. It stars [[Ryan O'Neal]], [[Marisa Berenson]], [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]], [[Leonard Rossiter]] and [[Hardy Krüger]]. The film recounts the early exploits and later unravelling of a fictional 18th-century Irish rogue and opportunist who marries a rich widow to climb the social ladder and assume her late husband's aristocratic position.

Kubrick began production on Barry Lyndon after his 1971 film, ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Kubrick had originally intended to direct a [[Stanley Kubrick's unrealized projects|biopic]] on [[Napoleon]], but lost his financing because of the commercial failure of a similar film, ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]''. Kubrick eventually directed Barry Lyndon, set during the [[Seven Years' War]], utilising his research from his Napoleon project. Filming lasted roughly 8 months, beginning in December 1973, and took place in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and [[West Germany]].
 
The film's cinematography has been described as ground-breaking. Especially notable are the long [[Two shot|double shots]], usually ended with a slow backwards zoom, the scenes shot entirely in candlelight, and the settings based on [[William Hogarth]] paintings. The exteriors were filmed on location in Ireland, England and West Germany, with the interiors shot mainly in London. The production was troubled; there were problems related to logistics, weather, and even politics (Kubrick feared that he might be an [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] hostage target), while the relationship between Kubrick and O'Neal was especially fraught and difficult.{{Citation needed|reason=This contradicts Kubrick's own claims (http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html)|date=August 2019}} O'Neal's perceived lack of on-screen depth and ability to portray a character arc have been repeatedly criticised; this perception was not shared by Kubrick, who subsequently praised O'Neal's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html | title= Kubrick speaks in regard to 'Barry Lyndon' | work=The Kubrick Site | date= | accessdate= 30 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Barry Lyndon'' won four Oscars at the [[48th Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]]. Although some critics took issue with the film's slow pace and restrained emotion, its reputation, like that of many of Kubrick's works, has strengthened over time, with many now regarding it as one of his greatest achievements.

==Plot==
===Part I===
:''By What Means Redmond Barry Acquired the Style and Title of Barry Lyndon''

An [[Omniscient narrator|omniscient]] (though possibly [[Unreliable narrator|unreliable]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Mark Crispin|title=Barry Lyndon Reconsidered|journal=The Georgia Review|year=1976|volume=XXX|issue=4|url= http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0086.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; narrator relates that in 1750s Ireland, the father of Redmond Barry is killed in a [[duel]] over a sale of some horses. The widow, disdaining offers of marriage, devotes herself to her only son.

Barry becomes infatuated with his older cousin, Nora Brady. Though she charms him during a card game, she later shows interest in a well-off British Army captain, John Quin, much to Barry's dismay. Nora and her family plan to leverage their finances through marriage, while Barry holds Quin in contempt and escalates the situation to a duel, when Barry shoots Quin. In the aftermath, he flees from the police towards Dublin, and is robbed by [[James Freney|Captain Feeney]], a [[highwayman]].

Dejected, Barry joins the British Army. Some time after, he encounters Captain Grogan, a family friend. Grogan informs him that Barry did not kill Quin, and that his dueling pistol had only been loaded with [[Tow (fibre)|tow]]. The duel was staged by Nora's family to get rid of Barry so that their finances would be secured through a lucrative marriage.

Barry's regiment is sent to Germany to fight in the [[Seven Years' War]], where Grogan is fatally wounded in a [[Skirmisher|skirmish]] preliminary to the [[Battle of Minden]]. Fed up with the war, Barry deserts the army, stealing an officer courier's uniform, horse, and identification papers after discovering the officer is homosexual. En route to neutral Holland, Barry encounters Frau Lieschen, a young German woman whose lover left for the war and never returned. Lieschen feeds and houses Barry. The two briefly become lovers. After leaving, Barry encounters the Prussian Captain Potzdorf, who, seeing through his disguise, offers him the choice of being turned back over to the British, where he will be shot as a deserter, or enlisting in the [[Prussian Army]]. Barry enlists in his second army and later receives a special commendation from [[Frederick the Great]] for saving Potzdorf's life in a battle.

Two years later, after the war ends in 1763, Barry is employed by Captain Potzdorf's uncle in the Prussian Ministry of Police to become a servant of the Chevalier de Balibari, an itinerant professional gambler. The Prussians suspect that the Chevalier is an Irish spy in the service of the Austrians, and send Barry as an undercover agent to verify this. Barry is overcome with emotion upon meeting a fellow Irishman, and reveals himself to the Chevalier immediately. They become confederates at the card table, where Barry and his fine eyesight relay information to the Chevalier. After he and the Chevalier cheat the Prince of Tübingen at the card table, the Prince accuses the Chevalier of cheating (without proof) and refuses to pay his debt and demands satisfaction. When Barry relays this to his Prussian handlers, they (still suspecting that the Chevalier is a spy) are wary of allowing another meeting between the Chevalier and the Prince. So the Prussians arrange for the Chevalier to be expelled from the country. Barry conveys this plan to the Chevalier, who flees in the night. The next morning, Barry, under disguise as the Chevalier, is escorted from Prussian territory by Potzdorf and other Prussian army officers.

Over the next few years, Barry and the Chevalier travel the spas and parlors of Europe, profiting from their gambling with Barry forcing payment from reluctant debtors with sword duels. Seeing that his life is going nowhere, Barry decides to marry into wealth. At a gambling table in [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], he encounters the beautiful and wealthy Countess of Lyndon. He seduces and later marries her after the death of her elderly husband, Sir Charles Lyndon. Because Lyndon is frail, sickly, and old, Barry's goading and verbal repartee ultimately send him into a fit of convulsions that ends with his death. Barry's coup-de-grace is the assertion that &quot;[[Last man|he who laughs last, wins]]&quot;.

===Part II===
:''Containing an Account of the Misfortunes and Disasters Which Befell Barry Lyndon''

In 1773, Barry takes the Countess' last name in marriage and settles in England to enjoy her wealth, still with no money of his own. Lord Bullingdon, Lady Lyndon's ten-year-old son by Sir Charles, does not approve of the marriage and quickly comes to despise Barry, calling him a &quot;common opportunist&quot; who does not truly love his mother. Barry retaliates by subjecting Bullingdon to systematic physical abuse. The Countess bears Barry a son, Bryan Patrick, but the marriage is unhappy: Barry is openly unfaithful and enjoys spending his wife's money on self-indulgent luxuries, while keeping his wife in seclusion.

Some years later, Barry's mother comes to live with him at the Lyndon estate. She warns her son that if Lady Lyndon were to die, all her wealth would go to her first-born son Lord Bullingdon, leaving Barry and his son Bryan penniless. Barry's mother advises him to obtain a noble title to protect himself. To further this goal, he cultivates the acquaintance of the influential Lord Wendover and begins to expend even larger sums of money to ingratiate himself to high society. All this effort is wasted, however, during a birthday party for Lady Lyndon. A now young adult Lord Bullingdon crashes the event where he publicly enumerates the reasons that he detests his stepfather so dearly, declaring it his intent to leave the family estate for as long as Barry remains there and married to his mother. Barry viciously assaults Bullingdon until he is physically restrained by the guests. This loses Barry the wealthy and powerful friends he has worked to entreat and he is cast out of polite society. Nevertheless, Bullingdon makes good on his word by leaving the estate and England.

In contrast to his mistreatment of his stepson, Barry proves an overindulgent and doting father to Bryan, with whom he spends all his time after Bullingdon's departure. He cannot refuse his son anything, and succumbs to Bryan's insistence on receiving a full-grown horse for his ninth birthday. Defying his parents' direct instructions that he ride the horse only in the presence of his father, the spoiled Bryan is thrown from the horse, paralyzed, and dies a couple of days later from his injuries.

The grief-stricken Barry turns to alcohol, while Lady Lyndon seeks solace in religion, assisted by the Reverend Samuel Runt, who had been tutor first to Lord Bullingdon and then to Bryan. Left in charge of the families' affairs while Barry and Lady Lyndon grieve, Barry's mother dismisses the Reverend, both because the family no longer needs (nor can afford, due to Barry's spending debts) a tutor and for fear that his influence worsens Lady Lyndon's condition. Plunging even deeper into grief, Lady Lyndon later attempts suicide (though she ingests only enough poison to make herself violently ill). The Reverend and the family's accountant Graham then seek out Lord Bullingdon. Upon hearing of these events, Lord Bullingdon returns to England where he finds Barry drunk in a gentlemen's club, mourning the loss of his son rather than being with Lady Lyndon. Bullingdon demands [[Duel#Offense and satisfaction|satisfaction]] for Barry's public assault, challenging him to a duel.

The duel with pistols is held in a [[tithe barn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Kubrick: The Definitive Edition|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=apbst3-ZYNoC|publisher = Macmillan|date = 2003-09-01|access-date = 2015-04-19|isbn = 9780571211081|first = Michel|last = Ciment|first2 = Gilbert|last2 = Adair|first3 = Robert|last3 = Bononno|page = 175}}&lt;/ref&gt; A coin toss gives Bullingdon the right of first fire, but he nervously misfires his pistol as he prepares to shoot. Terrified, Bullingdon demands another chance before he vomits in fear. Barry, reluctant to shoot Bullingdon, magnanimously [[Delope|fires into the ground]], but the unmoved Bullingdon refuses to let the duel end, claiming he has not received &quot;satisfaction&quot;. In the second round, Bullingdon shoots Barry in his left leg. At a nearby inn, a surgeon informs Barry that the leg will need to be amputated below the knee if he is to survive.

While Barry is recovering, Bullingdon re-takes control of the Lyndon estate. A few days later, Lord Bullingdon sends a very nervous Graham to the inn with a proposition: Lord Bullingdon will grant Barry an [[Life annuity|annuity]] of five hundred guineas a year on the condition that he leave England, with payments ending the moment should Barry ever return. Otherwise, with his credit and bank accounts exhausted, Barry's creditors and bill collectors will assuredly see that he is jailed. Defeated in mind and body, Barry accepts. Humiliated, he hobbles on crutches to a carriage.

The narrator states that Barry went first back to Ireland with his mother, then once he was fully recovered, he traveled to the European continent to resume his former profession of gambler (though without his former success). Barry kept his word and never returned to England or ever saw Lady Lyndon again. The final scene (set in December 1789) shows a middle-aged Lady Lyndon signing Barry's annuity cheque as her son looks on.

===Epilogue===
&lt;blockquote&gt;''It was in the reign of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] that the aforesaid personages lived and quarrelled; good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

}}
Critic Tim Robey suggests that the film &quot;makes you realise that the most undervalued aspect of Kubrick's genius could well be his way with actors.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; He adds that the [[Supporting character|supporting cast]] is a &quot;glittering procession of [[Cameo appearance|cameo]]s, not from star names but from vital character players.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt;

The cast featured Leon Vitali as the older Lord Bullingdon, who then became Kubrick's [[personal assistant]], working as the [[casting director]] on his following films, and supervising film-to-video transfers for Kubrick. Their relationship lasted until Kubrick's death. The film's cinematographer, [[John Alcott]], appears at the men's club in the non-speaking role of the man asleep in a chair near the title character when Lord Bullingdon challenges Barry to a duel. Kubrick's daughter [[Vivian Kubrick|Vivian]] also appears (in an uncredited role) as a guest at Bryan's birthday party.

Other Kubrick featured regulars were Leonard Rossiter (''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''), Steven Berkoff, Patrick Magee, Godfrey Quigley, Anthony Sharp and Philip Stone (''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''). Stone went on to feature in ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''.

==Production==
===Development===
After completing post production on  ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', Kubrick resumed planning a film about [[Napoleon]]. During pre-production, [[Sergei Bondarchuk]] and [[Dino De Laurentiis]]' ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'' was released, and failed at the box office. Reconsidering, Kubrick's financiers pulled funding, and he turned his attention towards an adaptation of [[Anthony Burgess]]'s 1962 novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Subsequently, Kubrick showed an interest in Thackeray's ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' but dropped the project when a serialised version for television was produced. He told an interviewer, &quot;At one time, ''Vanity Fair'' interested me as a possible film but, in the end, I decided the story could not be successfully compressed into the relatively short time-span of a feature film ... as soon as I read ''Barry Lyndon'' I became very excited about it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michel|title=Kubrick on Barry Lyndon|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html |accessdate=2007-05-31|last=Ciment| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070505010625/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html| archivedate= 5 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having earned Oscar nominations for ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' and ''A Clockwork Orange'', Kubrick's reputation in the early 1970s was that of &quot;a perfectionist [[auteur]] who loomed larger over his movies than any concept or star.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;&gt;Robey, Tim, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4524037/Barry-Lyndon-Kubricks-neglected-masterpiece.html &quot;Kubrick's Neglected Masterpiece&quot;], in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]] Review'' (31 January 2009), pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; His studio—Warner Bros.—was therefore &quot;eager to bankroll&quot; his next project, which Kubrick kept &quot;shrouded in secrecy&quot; from the press partly due to the furore surrounding the controversially violent ''A Clockwork Orange'' (particularly in the UK) and partly due to his &quot;long-standing [[paranoia]] about the [[tabloid press]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt;

Having felt compelled to set aside his plans for a film about Napoleon Bonaparte, Kubrick set his sights on Thackeray's 1844 &quot;[[satire|satirical]] picaresque about the fortune-hunting of an Irish rogue,&quot; ''Barry Lyndon'', the setting of which allowed Kubrick to take advantage of the copious period research he had done for the now-aborted ''Napoleon''.&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; At the time, Kubrick merely announced that his next film would star [[Ryan O'Neal]] (deemed &quot;a seemingly un-Kubricky choice of leading man&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt;) and [[Marisa Berenson]], a former ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover model&lt;ref name=&quot;Grdn2019&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Saner |first1=Emine |title='I did the first nude in Vogue': Marisa Berenson on being a blazing star of the 70s and beyond: Interview |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/30/marisa-berenson-warhol-dali-vogue-cabaret |accessdate=25 November 2019 |publisher=The Guardian |date=30 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and be shot largely in Ireland.&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; So heightened was the secrecy surrounding the film that &quot;Even Berenson, when Kubrick first approached her, was told only that it was to be an 18th-century costume piece [and] she was instructed to keep out of the sun in the months before production, to achieve the period-specific pallor he required.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt;

===Principal photography===
[[Principal photography]] took 300 days, from spring 1973 through to early 1974, with a break for Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Making Time in Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon: Art, History, and Empire|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0_I8BQAAQBAJ|publisher = Bloomsbury Academic|date = 2014-12-18|isbn = 9781441167750|language = en|first = Maria|last = Pramaggiore}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew arrived in [[Dublin]], Ireland in May 1973. [[Jan Harlan]] recalls that Kubrick &quot;loved his time in Ireland - he rented a lovely house west of Dublin, he loved the scenery and the culture and the people&quot;.
&lt;ref name=&quot;amp.independent.ie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amp.independent.ie/entertainment/movies/kubrick-in-ireland-the-making-of-barry-lyndon-31073211.html|access-date=2019-01-12|date=2015-03-22|work=[[The Independent]]|title=Kubrick in Ireland: the making of Barry Lyndon|first1=Paul|last1=Whitington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the exteriors were shot in Ireland, playing &quot;itself, England, and [[Prussia]] during the [[Seven Years' War]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; Drawing inspiration from &quot;the [[landscape painting|landscape]]s of [[Watteau]] and [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]],&quot; Kubrick and cinematographer Alcott also relied on the &quot;scrupulously researched [[art director|art direction]]&quot; of [[Ken Adam]] and [[Roy Walker (production designer)|Roy Walker]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; Alcott, Adam and Walker were among those who would win [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] for their &quot;amazing work&quot; on the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt;

Several of the interior scenes were filmed in [[Powerscourt House]], an 18th-century mansion in [[County Wicklow]], [[Republic of Ireland]]. The house was destroyed in an accidental fire several months after filming (November 1974), so the film serves as a record of the lost interiors, particularly the &quot;Saloon&quot; which was used for more than one scene. The [[Wicklow Mountains]] are visible, for example, through the window of the saloon during a scene set in Berlin. Other locations included [[Kells Priory]] (the English [[Redcoat (British army)|Redcoat]] encampment)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/b/BarryLyndon.html#kells|work=Movie-locations.com|title=Barry Lyndon film locations}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blenheim Palace]], [[Castle Howard]] (exteriors of the Lyndon estate), [[Huntington Castle, Clonegal]] (exterior), [[Corsham Court]] (various interiors and the music room scene), [[Petworth House]] (chapel), [[Stourhead]] (lake and temple), [[Longleat]], and [[Wilton House]] (interior and exterior) in England, [[Dunrobin Castle]] (exterior and garden as [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]]) in Scotland, [[Dublin Castle]] in Ireland (the chevalier's home), [[Ludwigsburg Palace]] near [[Stuttgart]] and [[Frederick the Great]]'s [[New Palace (Potsdam)|Neues Palais]] at [[Potsdam]] near [[Berlin]] (suggesting Berlin's main street [[Unter den Linden]] as construction in Potsdam had just begun in 1763). Some exterior shots were also filmed at [[Waterford Castle]] (now a luxury hotel and golf course) and [[Little Island, Waterford]]. [[Moorstown Castle]] in [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] also featured. Several scenes were filmed at [[Castletown House]] outside [[Carrick-on-Suir]], Co. Tipperary, and at [[Youghal]], Co. Cork.

The filming took place in the backdrop of some of the most intense years of [[the Troubles]] in Ireland, during which the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (Provisional IRA) was waging an armed campaign in order to bring about a [[United Ireland]].

On 30 January 1974 while filming in Dublin City's [[Phoenix Park]] shooting had to be cancelled due to the chaos caused by 14 bomb threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=yrlPBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT128&amp;dq=stanley+kubrick+ira&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjar8rJgOrcAhVFJMAKHf_pCEUQ6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=stanley+kubrick+ira&amp;f=false|title=Making Time in Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon: Art, History, and Empire|first=Maria|last=Pramaggiore|date=18 December 2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One day a phone call was received and Kubrick was given 24 hours to leave the country, he left within 12 hours. The phone call alleged that the Provisional IRA had him on a hit list and Harlan recalls &quot;Whether the threat was a hoax or it was real, almost doesn't matter ... Stanley was not willing to take the risk. He was threatened, and he packed his bag and went home&quot;

Kubrick was &quot;determined not to reproduce the set-bound, [[stage lighting instrument|artificially lit]] look of other [[costume drama]]s from that time.&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; After &quot;tinker[ing] with different combinations of [[Photographic lens|lenses]] and [[film stock]],&quot; the production obtained three super-fast 50mm lenses ([[Carl Zeiss Planar 50mm f/0.7|Carl Zeiss Planar 50mm ''f''/0.7]]) developed by [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] for use by [[NASA]] in the [[Apollo moon landing]]s, which Kubrick had discovered.&lt;ref name= &quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= DiGiulio&gt;[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/ac/len/page1.htm Two Special Lenses for &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;], Ed DiGiulio (President, Cinema Products Corp.), ''American Cinematographer''&lt;/ref&gt; These super-fast lenses &quot;with their huge [[lens aperture|aperture]] (the film actually features the lowest [[f-number|f-stop]] in film history) and fixed [[focal length]]&quot; were problematic to mount, and were extensively modified into three versions by Cinema Products Corp. for Kubrick so to gain a wider angle of view, with input from optics expert Richard Vetter of [[Todd-AO]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= DiGiulio/&gt; The rear element of the lens had to be 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm away from the film plane, requiring special modification to the rotating camera shutter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Ciment |first1=Michel|title= Three Interviews with Stanley Kubrick|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html |website=The Kubrick Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allowed Kubrick and Alcott to shoot scenes lit in candlelight to an average lighting volume of only three [[candela]], &quot;recreating the huddle and glow of a pre-electrical age.&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; In addition, Kubrick had the entire film [[Push processing|push-developed]] by one stop.&lt;ref name= DiGiulio/&gt;

Although Kubrick's express desire was to avoid electric lighting where possible, most shots were achieved with conventional lenses and lighting, but were lit to deliberately mimic natural light rather than for compositional reasons. In addition to potentially seeming more realistic, these methods also gave a particular period look to the film which has often been likened to 18th-century paintings (which were, of course, depicting a world devoid of electric lighting), in particular owing &quot;a lot to [[William Hogarth]], with whom Thackeray had always been fascinated.&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt;

The film is widely regarded as having a stately, static, painterly quality,&lt;ref name= &quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; mostly due to its lengthy wide angle long shots. To illuminate the more notable interior scenes, artificial lights called &quot;Mini-Brutes&quot; were placed outside and aimed through the windows, which were covered in a diffuse material to scatter the light evenly through the room rather than being placed inside for maximum use as most conventional films do.  An example of this method occurs in the scene where Barry duels Lord Bullingdon. Though it appears to be lit entirely with natural light, one can see that the light coming in through the cross-shaped windows in the tithe barn appears blue in color, while the main lighting of the scene coming in from the side is not. This is because the light through the cross-shaped windows is daylight from the sun, which when recorded on the film stock used by Kubrick showed up as blue-tinted compared to the incandescent electric light coming in from the side.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Despite such slight tinting effects, this method of lighting not only gave the look of natural daylight coming in through the windows, but it also protected the historic locations from the damage caused by mounting the lights on walls or ceilings and the heat from the lights. This helped the film &quot;fit… perfectly with Kubrick's [[wikt:gilded cage|gilded-cage]] aesthetic – the film is consciously a museum piece, its characters pinned to the frame like butterflies.&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt;

The film's period setting allowed Kubrick to indulge his penchant for classical music, and the film score uses pieces by Bach, Vivaldi, Paisiello, Mozart, and Schubert.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;The soundtrack album attributes the composition of the Hohenfriedberger March to Frederick the Great; the origin of this attribution is uncertain&lt;/ref&gt; The piece most associated with the film, however, is the main title music, Handel's Sarabande from the Keyboard suite in D minor (HWV 437). Originally for solo [[harpsichord]], the versions for the main and end titles are performed with orchestral strings, harpsichord, and [[timpani]]. The score also includes [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish folk music]], including Seán Ó Riada's song ''Women of Ireland'', arranged by Paddy Moloney and performed by The Chieftains. ''[[The British Grenadiers]]'' also features in scenes with Redcoats marching.

===Contemporaneous===
The film &quot;was not the commercial success [[Warner Bros.]] had been hoping for&quot; within the United States,&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; although it fared better in Europe. In the US it earned $9.1 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;film&quot;/&gt; Ultimately, the film grossed a worldwide total of $31.5 million on an $11 million budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072684/|title=Barry Lyndon|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This mixed reaction saw the film (in the words of one retrospective review) &quot;greeted, on its release, with dutiful admiration – but not love. Critics ... rail[ed] against the perceived coldness of Kubrick's style, the film's self-conscious artistry and slow pace. Audiences, on the whole, rather agreed{{nbsp}}...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that the film &quot;is almost aggressive in its cool detachment. It defies us to care, it forces us to remain detached about its stately elegance.&quot; He added, &quot;This must be one of the most beautiful films ever made.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/barry-lyndon-1974 |title=Barry Lyndon |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=20 September 1975 |website=[[RogerEbert.com]] |accessdate=17 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film &quot;another fascinating challenge from one of our most remarkable, independent-minded directors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Canby, Vincent (19 December 1975). &quot;Screen: Kubrick's 'Barry Lyndon' Is Brilliant in Its Images&quot;. ''[[The New York Times]]''. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, &quot;I found 'Barry Lyndon' to be quite obvious about its intentions and thoroughly successful in achieving them. Kubrick has taken a novel about a social class and has turned it into an utterly comfortable story that conveys the stunning emptiness of upper-class life only 200 years past.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Siskel, Gene (26 December 1975). &quot;'Barry Lyndon': Beauty and grace outweigh pace in a Kubrick classic&quot;. ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 3, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He ranked the film fifth on his year-end list of the best films of 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Siskel, Gene (4 January 1976). &quot;Ten films outclass the publicity pitch&quot;. ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 6, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Champlin]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it &quot;the motion picture equivalent of one of those very large, very heavy, very expensive, very elegant and very dull books that exist solely to be seen on coffee tables. It is ravishingly beautiful and incredibly tedious in about equal doses, a succession of salon quality still photographs—as often as not very still indeed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Champlin, Charles (19 December 1975). &quot;A Rake's Lack of Progress&quot;. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Part IV, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, &quot;It's not inaccurate to describe 'Barry Lyndon' as a masterpiece, but it's a deadend masterpiece, an [[objet d'art]] rather than a movie. It would be more at home, and perhaps easier to like, on the bookshelf, next to something like 'The Age of the [[Grand Tour]],' than on the silver screen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;'Barry' Is All Dressed Up, but Going Where?&quot; ''[[The Washington Post]]''. 25 December 1975. H14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pauline Kael]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote that &quot;Kubrick has taken a quick-witted story&quot; and &quot;controlled it so meticulously that he's drained the blood out of it,&quot; adding, &quot;It's a coffee-table movie; we might as well be at a three-hour slide show for art-history majors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kael, Pauline (29 December 1975). &quot;The Current Cinema&quot;. ''[[The New Yorker]]''. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

This &quot;air of disappointment&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphReview&quot;/&gt; factored into Kubrick's decision for his next film –  [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' – a project that would not only please him artistically, but also be more likely to succeed financially.

===Re-evaluation===
In recent years, the film has gained a more positive reaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebert 2009&quot; /&gt; On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 70 reviews, with an average rating of 8.39. The website's critical consensus reads, &quot;Cynical, ironic, and suffused with seductive natural lighting, Barry Lyndon is a complex character piece of a hapless man doomed by Georgian society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/barry_lyndon/|title=Barry Lyndon (1975)|accessdate=7 June 2018|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] added the film to his 'Great Movies' list on 9 September 2009, writing, &quot;Stanley Kubrick's 'Barry Lyndon,' received indifferently in 1975, has grown in stature in the years since and is now widely regarded as one of the master's best. It is certainly in every frame a Kubrick film: technically awesome, emotionally distant, remorseless in its doubt of human goodness.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ebert 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/barry-lyndon-1975|accessdate=2018-12-18|publisher=rogerebert.chicagosuntimes.com|title=Barry Lyndon (1975)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinematic analysis===
As with any Stanley Kubrick film, there are a great deal of subtle messages and deeper meanings. The main theme explored in Barry Lyndon is one of fate and destiny. Barry is pushed through life by a series of key events, some of which seem unavoidable. As Roger Ebert says, &quot;He is a man to whom things happen.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rogerebert.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/barry-lyndon-1975|title=Barry Lyndon Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (1975) - Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=www.rogerebert.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He declines to eat with the highwaymen Captain Feeney, where he would most likely have been robbed, but is robbed anyway farther down the road. The narrator repeatedly emphasizes the role of fate as he announces events before they unfold on screen, like Brian's death and Bullingdon seeking satisfaction. This theme of fate is also developed in the reoccurring motif of the painting. Just like the events featured in the paintings, Barry is participating in events which always were. Another major theme is between father and son. Barry lost his father at a young age and throughout the film he seeks and attaches himself to father-figures. Examples include his uncle, Grogan, and the Chevalier. When given the chance to be a father, Barry loves his son to the point of spoiling him. This contrasts with his role as a father to Lord Bullingdon, whom he disregards and punishes.&lt;ref name=&quot;rogerebert.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/32367/1/why-barry-lyndon-is-stanley-kubrick-s-seminal-masterpiece|title=Why Barry Lyndon is Stanley Kubrick’s secret masterpiece|last=Dazed|date=8 August 2016|website=Dazed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/28/barry-lyndon-review-stanley-kubrick-ryan-o-neal|title=Barry Lyndon review – Kubrick's intimate epic of utter lucidity|first=Peter|last=Bradshaw|date=28 July 2016|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source novel==
Kubrick based his adapted screenplay on [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s ''[[The Luck of Barry Lyndon]]'' (republished as the novel ''Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq.),'' a [[picaresque]] tale written and published in serial form in 1844.

The film departs from the novel in several ways. In Thackeray's writings, events are related in the first person by Barry himself. A comic tone pervades the work, as Barry proves both a raconteur and an [[unreliable narrator]]. Kubrick's film, by contrast, presents the story objectively. Though the film contains voice-over (by actor [[Michael Hordern]]), the comments expressed are not Barry's, but those of an omniscient narrator. Kubrick felt that using a first-person narrative would not be useful in a film adaptation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html |title=Visual memory | place = UK | type = interview |accessdate=2010-03-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100210204149/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html| archivedate= 10 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I believe Thackeray used Redmond Barry to tell his own story in a deliberately distorted way because it made it more interesting. Instead of the omniscient author, Thackeray used the imperfect observer, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say the dishonest observer, thus allowing the reader to judge for himself, with little difficulty, the probable truth in Redmond Barry's view of his life. This technique worked extremely well in the novel but, of course, in a film you have objective reality in front of you all of the time, so the effect of Thackeray's first-person story-teller could not be repeated on the screen. It might have worked as comedy by the juxtaposition of Barry's version of the truth with the reality on the screen, but I don't think that Barry Lyndon should have been done as a comedy.}}

Kubrick made several changes to the plot, including the addition of the final duel.
