'''''Roman Holiday''''' is a 1953 American [[romantic comedy]] film directed and produced by [[William Wyler]]. It stars [[Gregory Peck]] as a reporter and [[Audrey Hepburn]] as a royal princess out to see Rome on her own. Hepburn won an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her performance; the screenplay and costume design also won.

It was written by [[John Dighton]] and [[Dalton Trumbo]], though with Trumbo on the [[Hollywood blacklist]], he did not receive a credit; instead, [[Ian McLellan Hunter]] [[front (identity)|fronted]] for him. Trumbo's credit was reinstated when the film was released on [[DVD]] in 2003. On December 19, 2011, full credit for Trumbo's work was restored. Blacklisted director [[Bernard Vorhaus]] worked on the film as an assistant director under a pseudonym.&lt;ref name=kpcc&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheryl Devall|first=Paige Osburn|title=Blacklisted writer gets credit restored after 60 years for Oscar-winning film|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2011/12/19/30417/blacklisted-writer-gets-credit-restored-oscar-winn/|accessdate=December 20, 2011|newspaper=89.3 KPCC|date=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes-verrier&gt;{{cite news|last=Verrier|first=Richard|title=Writers Guild restores screenplay credit to Trumbo for 'Roman Holiday'|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/12/writers-guild-restores-screenplay-credit-to-trumbo-for-roman-holiday.html|accessdate=December 20, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was shot at the [[Cinecittà]] studios and [[location shooting|on location]] around [[Rome]] during the &quot;[[Hollywood on the Tiber]]&quot; era. The film was screened in the 14th [[Venice film festival]] within the official program.

In 1999, ''Roman Holiday'' was selected for preservation in the [[United States]] [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
[[File:Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck in Roman Holiday trailer.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.1|Filmed on location, several scenes show landmarks such as the [[Spanish Steps]].]]
Ann ([[Audrey Hepburn]]), a crown princess on a state visit to Rome, becomes frustrated with her tightly scheduled life and secretly leaves her country's embassy. The delayed effect of a sedative makes her fall asleep on a bench, where Joe Bradley ([[Gregory Peck]]), an expatriate reporter for the &quot;American News Service&quot;, finds her without recognizing who she is. Thinking she is intoxicated, Joe lets her spend the night in his apartment.

The next morning, Joe hurries off late to work and gives his editor, Mr. Hennessy ([[Hartley Power]]), false details of his press conference with the princess. When Hennessy informs him that the event had been cancelled and shows him a news item about her “sudden illness, &quot; he realizes who it actually is in his apartment. Seeing an opportunity, Joe proposes getting an exclusive interview with the princess and Hennessy agrees.

Joe hurries home and, hiding the fact that he is a reporter, offers to show his guest &quot;Anya&quot; around Rome. He also calls his photographer friend, Irving Radovich ([[Eddie Albert]]), to tag along and secretly take pictures. However, Ann declines Joe's offer and leaves. Enjoying her freedom, she explores an outdoor market. Joe follows and ‘accidentally’ meets her on the [[Spanish Steps]]. This time he convinces her to spend the day with him and takes her to a street café, where he meets up with Irving. Later, when she tries to drive the [[Vespa]] on which he has taken her for a ride, they are arrested and only get away with it when he and Irving show their press passes.

[[File:Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck on Vespa in Roman Holiday trailer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.17|Joe and Ann career through Rome on a [[Vespa]] [[scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]]]]
That night, at a dance on a boat, government agents called in by the embassy track Ann down and try to force her away. Ann takes part in the fight that breaks out, during which Joe is ambushed and falls into the river and Ann jumps in to save him. After they swim away and police arrest the agents, they share a kiss as they sit shivering on the riverbank. Later, knowing her royal responsibilities must resume, Ann bids a tearful farewell to Joe and returns to the embassy. 

Meanwhile, Hennessy has come to suspect that the princess was not ill as claimed and tries to get Joe to admit what he knows about it. Joe, however, has decided not to write the story, although he later tells Irving that he is free to sell his photographs. They then leave for the postponed press conference at the embassy, surprising Princess Ann. 

At the end of the interview, the princess unexpectedly asks to meet the journalists, shaking hands and speaking briefly with each. As she reaches Joe and Irving, the latter presents her with an envelope containing the photographs he had taken. After the interview ends, Joe walks away alone.

==Cast==
[[File:Gregory Peck in Roman Holiday trailer cropped.jpg|thumb|192px|[[Gregory Peck]] as Joe Bradley]]
Wyler first offered the role to Hollywood favorite [[Cary Grant]]. Grant declined,&lt;ref name=Jaynes-Trach&gt;Jaynes, Barbara Grant; Trachtenberg, Robert. [http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=76185 ''Cary Grant: A Class Apart'']. Burbank, California: [[Turner Classic Movies]] (TCM) and [[Turner Entertainment]]. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; believing he was too old to play Hepburn's love interest (though he played opposite her ten years later in ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]''.) Other sources say Grant declined because he knew all of the attention would be centered around the princess.&lt;ref&gt;DVD special feature&lt;/ref&gt; Peck's contract gave him solo [[billing (film)|star billing]], with newcomer Hepburn listed much less prominently in the credits. Halfway through the filming, Peck suggested to Wyler that he elevate her to equal billing—an almost unheard-of gesture in Hollywood.

Wyler had initially considered [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Jean Simmons]] for this role, but both were unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Remembering ''Roman Holiday''&quot;, special feature on the DVD&lt;/ref&gt; Wyler was very excited to find Hepburn, but he did not choose her until after a screen test. Wyler was not able to stay and film this himself, but told the assistant director to ask the cameraman and the sound man to continue recording after the assistant director said &quot;cut&quot; so that she would be seen in a relaxed state after having performed a dignified, subdued scene from the film.&lt;ref&gt;According to Wyler's daughter, the producer Catherine Wyler, in the DVD's special feature &quot;Remembering ''Roman Holiday''&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The candid footage won her the role; some of it was later included in the original theatrical trailer for the film, along with additional screen test footage showing Hepburn trying on some of Ann's costumes and even cutting her own hair (referring to a scene in the film). ''Roman Holiday'' was not Hepburn's first acting appearance (she had appeared in Dutch and British films from 1948; and on stage, including the title role in a Broadway adaptation of ''[[Gigi (play)|Gigi]]'') but it was her first major film role and first appearance in an American film. Wyler wanted an &quot;anti-Italian&quot; actress who was different from the curvy Italian ''maggiorate'' like [[Gina Lollobrigida]], and said that &quot;She was perfect  .... his new star had no arse, no tits, no tight-fitting clothes, no high heels. In short a Martian. She will be a sensation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Levy |first= Shawn |title= Dolce Vita Confidential |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear=  |year= 2016 |publisher=  Weidenfeld and Nicolson |location= London |isbn= 9781474606158 |oclc= |page= 112 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Richard Curtis film ''[[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]]'' has been likened to &quot;a 90's London-set version of ''Roman Holiday''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Elley, [https://variety.com/1999/film/reviews/notting-hill-1200457114 ''Variety'', 30 April 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of allusions to it in the film, in which the princess character is replaced with &quot;Hollywood royalty&quot; and the commoner is a British bookshop owner.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bradshaw, &quot;My Guilty Pleasure:Notting Hill&quot;, [https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/mar/17/notting-hill-julia-roberts-richard-curtis-film-guilty-pleasure ''The Guardian'', 17 March 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Paramount Pictures has since licensed three adaptations of ''Roman Holiday'' into musicals:

* In 2012, a [[Roman Holiday (musical)|musical stage version]], following the plot while using the songs of [[Cole Porter]], was presented in [[Minneapolis]].
