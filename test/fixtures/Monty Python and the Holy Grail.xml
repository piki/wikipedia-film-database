'''''Monty Python and the Holy Grail''''' is a 1975 British independent [[slapstick]] [[comedy film]]&lt;!-- Do not alter genre without discussion. --&gt; concerning the [[Arthurian legend]], written and performed by the [[Monty Python]] comedy group of [[Graham Chapman]], [[John Cleese]], [[Terry Gilliam]], [[Eric Idle]], [[Terry Jones]] and [[Michael Palin]], and directed by Gilliam and Jones.{{refn|group=n|name=&quot;Directors&quot;|Though the [[opening credits]] comedically identify the directors as &quot;40 Specially Trained Ecuadorian Mountain Llamas, 6 Venezuelan Red Llamas, 142 Mexican Whooping Llamas, 14 North Chilean Guanacos (Closely Related to the Llama), Reg Llama of Brixton, 76000 Battery Llamas From 'Llama-Fresh' Farms Ltd.

In contrast to the group's first film, ''[[And Now for Something Completely Different]]'', a compilation of [[sketch comedy|sketches]] from the first two television series, ''Holy Grail'' draws on new material, parodying the legend of [[King Arthur]]'s quest for the [[Holy Grail]]. 30 years later, Idle used the film as the basis for the musical ''[[Spamalot]]''.

''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' grossed more than any British film exhibited in the US in 1975. In the US, it was selected as the second best comedy of all time in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] special ''[[Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time]]''. In the UK, readers of ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine ranked it the fifth greatest comedy film of all time; a similar poll of [[Channel 4]] viewers placed it sixth (2000).&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/948331.stm &quot;Life of Brian tops comedy poll&quot;].

==Plot==
In 932 AD, [[King Arthur]] and his squire, Patsy, travel throughout [[Britain (place name)|Britain]] searching for men to join the [[Knights of the Round Table]]. Arthur recruits [[Bedivere|Sir Bedevere the Wise]], [[Lancelot|Sir Lancelot the Brave]], [[Galahad|Sir Galahad the Pure]], Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, and Sir Not-Appearing-in-this-Film, along with their squires and Robin's troubadours. Arthur leads the men to [[Camelot]], but decides it is &quot;a silly place&quot; and sets off elsewhere. As they turn away, [[God]] (an image of [[W. G. Grace]]) speaks to them and gives Arthur the task of finding the [[Holy Grail]].

Arthur and his men search the land for clues to the Grail. They come to a castle occupied by French soldiers who claim to have the Grail and insult the Englishmen. Arthur and his men come up with a plan to sneak in using a [[Trojan Horse|Trojan Rabbit]], but they mishandle its execution and are forced away. Arthur decides that the knights should go their separate ways to search for clues to the Grail's whereabouts. A modern-day historian being filmed for a documentary describing the Arthurian legends is abruptly killed by a knight on horseback, triggering a modern-day police investigation.

On the knights' travels, Arthur and Bedevere attempt to satisfy the strange requests of the dreaded [[Knights Who Say Ni]]. Sir Robin avoids a fight with a Three-Headed Giant by running away while the heads are arguing. Sir Galahad is led by a grail-shaped beacon to Castle [[Anthrax]], populated by 160 women, but to his chagrin is &quot;rescued&quot; by Lancelot. Lancelot, after finding a note from Swamp Castle believed to be from a lady being forced to marry against her will, rushes to the castle and kills nearly the entire wedding party, only to discover that the note was sent by an effeminate prince.

Arthur and his knights regroup and are joined by Brother Maynard and monk followers. They meet Tim the [[Magician (fantasy)|Enchanter]], who directs them to a cave where the location of the Grail is said to be written, but it is guarded by the deadly [[Rabbit of Caerbannog]]. After the Rabbit kills several of the knights, Arthur uses the Holy [[grenade|Hand Grenade]] of [[Antioch]], provided by Maynard, to destroy the creature. Inside, they find the inscription from [[Joseph of Arimathea]], directing them to the Castle of Aarrgh. After evading a giant monster, they arrive at the Bridge of Death and must answer three questions from the bridge-keeper to pass. Lancelot answers first and correctly, and passes on. Robin and Galahad fail to answer correctly and are thrown over the bridge; then Arthur tricks the bridge-keeper, allowing him and Bedevere to pass.

When Arthur and Bedevere reach the bridge's end, they cannot find Lancelot, unaware he was arrested by the modern-day policemen investigating the historian's death. Arthur and Bedevere find the Castle of Aarrgh, but it is occupied by the French. They amass a large army of knights to assault the castle, when suddenly a large police force shows up, arrests Arthur and Bedevere for the historian's death, and shuts down the film's production.

==Production==
===Development===
[[File:Galahad grail.jpg|300px|thumb|The legend of the [[Holy Grail]] provided a unifying motif for the film.]]
Fifteen months before the [[BBC]] visited the set in May 1974,{{sfn|Palin|2006|p=174}} the [[Monty Python]] troupe assembled the first version of the screenplay.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCLocation&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media|author=Monty Python troupe |chapter=BBC Film Night: Monty Python &amp; the Holy Grail Location Report |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail |date=2001 |publisher=Columbia Tristar |medium=DVD }}&lt;/ref&gt; When half of the resulting material was set in the [[Middle Ages]], and half was set in the present day, the group opted to focus on the Middle Ages, revolving on the legend of the [[Holy Grail]]. By the fourth or fifth version of their screenplay, the story was complete, and the cast joked the fact that the Grail was never retrieved would be &quot;a big let-down ... a great anti-climax&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCLocation&quot;/&gt; [[Graham Chapman]] said a challenge was incorporating scenes that did not fit the Holy Grail motif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|last=Chapman |first=Graham |chapter=BBC Film Night: Monty Python &amp; the Holy Grail Location Report |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail |date=2001 |publisher=Columbia Tristar |medium=DVD }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither [[Terry Gilliam]] nor [[Terry Jones]] had directed a film before, and described it as a learning experience in which they would learn to make a film by making an entire full-length film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|last1=Gilliam |first1=Terry |last2=Jones |first2=Terry |chapter=BBC Film Night: Monty Python &amp; the Holy Grail Location Report |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail |date=2001 |publisher=Columbia Tristar |medium=DVD }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cast humorously described the novice directing style as employing the level of mutual disrespect always found in Monty Python's work.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCLocation&quot;/&gt;

The film’s initial budget of approximately £200,000 was raised by convincing 10 separate investors to contribute £20,000 apiece. Three of those investors were the rock bands [[Pink Floyd]], [[Led Zeppelin]], and [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], who were persuaded to help fund the film by Tony Stratton-Smith, head of Charisma Records (the record label that released Python’s early comedy albums).&lt;ref name=&quot;Mental Floss&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/65207/15-facts-about-monty-python-and-holy-grail|title=15 Facts about Monty Python and the Holy Grail|first=Sean|last=Hutchinson|date=16 June 2016|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Terry Gilliam, the Pythons turned to rock stars like Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and [[Elton John]] for finance as the studios refused to fund the film and rock stars saw it as &quot;a good tax write-off&quot; due to UK [[income tax]] being &quot;as high as 90%&quot; at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardian 090302&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/mar/09/features.phelimoneill|title=Snake Charmer-Monty Python And The Holy Grail was Terry Gilliam's first film as a director.

This was at the time income tax was running as high as 90%, so we turned to rock stars for finance.

It was like [[The Producers (1967 film)|The Producers]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' was mostly shot on location in [[Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukonscreen.com/egjcibb-Monty-Python-and-the-Holy-Grail-%281975%29.html |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail filming locations |publisher=Ukonscreen.com |accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly around [[Doune Castle]], [[Glen Coe]], and the privately owned [[Castle Stalker]].{{sfn|Li|2011}} The many castles seen throughout the film were mainly either Doune Castle shot from different angles or [[hanging miniature]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;QuestLocation&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media|last=Jones |first=Terry |chapter=The Quest for the Holy Grail Locations |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail |date=2001 |publisher=Columbia Tristar |medium=DVD }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several exceptions to this: the very first exterior shot of a castle at the beginning of the film is [[Kidwelly Castle]] in South Wales, and the single exterior shot of the Swamp Castle during &quot;Tale of Sir Lancelot&quot; is [[Bodiam Castle]] in East Sussex;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jun/02/guardianspecial4.guardianspecial2 |title=Bodiam Castle, East Sussex |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=18 April 2013 |location=London |date=5 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; all subsequent shots of the exterior and interior of those scenes were filmed at Doune Castle. Production designer Julian Doyle recounted that his crew constructed walls in the forest near Doune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|last=Doyle |first=Julian |chapter=The Quest for the Holy Grail Locations |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail |date=2001 |publisher=Columbia Tristar |medium=DVD }}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry Jones later recalled the crew had selected more castles around Scotland for locations, but during the two weeks prior to [[principal photography]], the Scottish Department of the Environment declined permission for use of the castles in its jurisdiction, for fear of damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;QuestLocation&quot;/&gt;

At the start of &quot;The Tale of Sir Robin&quot;, there is a slow camera zoom in on rocky scenery (that in the voice over is described as &quot;the dark forest of Ewing&quot;). This is actually a still photograph of the Gorge at [[Mount Buffalo National Park]] in Victoria, Australia. Doyle stated in 2000 during an interview with ''[[Hotdog (magazine)|Hotdog]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/mpholygrail/article5.html|title=Never have so few suffered for the enjoyment of so many: the making of Monty Python And The Holy Grail|date=October 2000|at=via [[Angelfire.com]] (convenience link)|magazine=[[Hotdog (magazine)|Hotdog]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it was a still image filmed with candles underneath the frame (to give a heat haze). This was a low-cost method of achieving a convincing location effect.
 
On the DVD audio commentary, Cleese described challenges shooting and editing Castle Anthrax in &quot;The Tale of Sir Galahad&quot;, with what he felt the most comedic [[take]] being unused because an anachronistic coat was visible in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|last=Cleese |first=John |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail commentary |date=2001 |publisher=Columbia Tristar |medium=DVD }}&lt;/ref&gt; Castle Anthrax was also shot in one part of Doune, where costume designer Hazel Pethig advised against [[Nudity in film|nudity]], dressing the girls in [[Shift (clothing)|shifts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;QuestLocation&quot;/&gt;

In the scene where the knights were combatting the [[Rabbit of Caerbannog]], a real white rabbit was used, switched with [[puppet]]s for its killings.&lt;ref name=&quot;GilliamJones&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media|last1=Gilliam |first1=Terry |last2=Jones |first2=Terry |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail commentary |date=2001 |publisher=Columbia Tristar |medium=DVD }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was covered with red liquid to simulate blood, though the rabbit's owner did not want the animal dirty and was kept unaware. The liquid was difficult to remove from the fur.&lt;ref name=&quot;GilliamJones&quot;/&gt; He also stated that he thought that, had they been more experienced in filmmaking, the crew would have just purchased a rabbit instead. Otherwise, the rabbit himself was unharmed. Also, the rabbit-bite effects were done by special puppetry by both Gilliam and SFX technician John Horton.

As chronicled in ''The Life of Python'', ''The First 20 Years of Monty Python'', and ''The Pythons' Autobiography'', it was revealed that Chapman was suffering from [[acrophobia]], trembling, and bouts of forgetfulness during filming. These were the results of Chapman's long-standing alcohol addiction, and he decided from that moment on to remain &quot;on an even keel&quot; while the production continued. Nearly three years after ''Holy Grail'', Chapman vowed to quit drinking altogether (which he successfully achieved in December 1977).

Originally the knight characters were going to ride real horses, but after it became clear that the film's small budget precluded real horses (except for a lone horse appearing in a couple of scenes), the Pythons decided that their characters would mime horse-riding while their [[Porter (carrier)|porters]] trotted behind them banging [[coconut]] shells together. The joke was derived from the old-fashioned [[Foley (filmmaking)|sound effect]] used by radio shows to convey the sound of hooves clattering. This was later referred to in the German release of the film, which translated the title as ''Die Ritter der Kokosnuß''.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

The opening credits of the film feature pseudo-[[Swedish language|Swedish]] subtitles, which soon turn into an appeal to visit Sweden and see the country's [[moose]]. The subtitles are soon stopped, but moose references continue throughout the actual credits until the credits are stopped again and restarted in a different visual style and with references to [[llama]]s, animals often mentioned in ''Flying Circus''. The subtitles were written by Michael Palin as a way to &quot;entertain the 'captive' audience&quot; at the beginning of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mindhole Blowers: 20 Facts About Monty Python and the Holy Grail That Might Make You Say &quot;Ni!&quot;|url=http://www.pajiba.com/seriously_random_lists/mindhole-blowers-20-facts-about-monty-python-and-the-holy-grail-that-might-make-you-say-ni.php|website=pajiba.com|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film had its television premiere 25 February 1977 on the ''[[CBS Late Movie]]''.{{sfn|McCall|2013}} Reportedly, the Pythons were displeased to discover a number of edits were done by the network to reduce use of [[profanity]] and the showing of blood.

The project was conceived by the original film's respective Producer and Co-Director, John Goldstone and [[Terry Gilliam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dailyllama&quot;&gt;[http://www.dailyllama.com/news/2004/llama262.html NEWS 2004_12_14 - Monty Python is Animators' Delight].

==Reaction and legacy==
Contemporary reviews were mixed. [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote in a favorable review that the film had &quot;some low spots,&quot; but had gags which were &quot;nonstop, occasionally inspired and should not be divulged, though it's not giving away too much to say that I particularly liked a sequence in which the knights, to gain access to an enemy castle, come up with the idea of building a Trojan rabbit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |date=April 28, 1975 |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Champlin]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' was also positive, writing that the film, &quot;like [[Mad (magazine)|Mad]] comics, is not certain to please every taste. But its youthful exuberance and its rousing zaniness are hard not to like. As a matter of fact, the sense of fun is dangerously contagious.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Champlin|Champlin, Charles]] (July 23, 1975). &quot;'Monty Python Opens at Plaza&quot;. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Part IV, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Penelope Gilliatt]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' called the film &quot;often recklessly funny and sometimes a matter of comic genius.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilliatt |first=Penelope |authorlink=Penelope Gilliatt |date=May 5, 1975 |title=The Current Cinema |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |page=117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reviews were less enthusiastic. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the storyline was &quot;basically an excuse for set pieces, some amusing, others overdone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=March 19, 1975  |title=Film Reviews: Monty Python And The Holy Grail |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film two-and-a-half stars, writing that he felt &quot;it contained about 10 very funny moments and 70 minutes of silence. Too many of the jokes took too long to set up, a trait shared by both '[[Blazing Saddles]]' and '[[Young Frankenstein]].' I guess I prefer Monty Python in chunks, in its original, television revue format.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gene Siskel|Siskel, Gene]] (June 9, 1975). &quot;Now comes King Arthur to cut 'em off at the pass&quot;. ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 3, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the film &quot;a fitfully amusing spoof of the Arthurian legends&quot; but &quot;rather poky&quot; in tempo, citing the running gag of Swedish subtitles in the opening credits as an example of how the Pythons &quot;don't know when to let go of any ''shtik''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arnold |first=Gary |date=July 17, 1975 |title=...Python's Arthurian Knights |journal=[[The Washington Post]] |page=C1, C11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geoff Brown of ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' wrote in a mixed review that &quot;the team's visual buffooneries and verbal rigamaroles (some good, some bad, but mostly indifferent) are piled on top of each other with no attention to judicious timing or structure, and a form which began as a jaunty assault on the well-made revue sketch and an ingenious misuse of television's fragmented style of presentation, threatens to become as unyielding and unfruitful as the conventions it originally attacked.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=Geoff |date=April 1975 |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |page=85 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's reputation grew over time. In 2000, readers of ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine voted ''Holy Grail'' the fifth greatest comedy film of all time.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt; The next Python film, ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]'', was ranked first.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt; A similar poll of [[Channel 4]] viewers in 2005 placed ''Holy Grail'' in sixth (with ''Life of Brian'' again topping the list).

[[File:Azariaspamalot.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Hank Azaria]] in a production of ''[[Spamalot]]''.]]
In 2005, the film spawned a [[Tony Award]]-winning [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical smash hit spinoff, ''[[Spamalot]]''. Written primarily by Idle, the show has more of an overarching plot and leaves out certain portions of the movie due to difficulties in rendering certain effects on stage. Nonetheless, many of the jokes from the film are present in the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGuigan|first=Cathleen|title=A Very Swordid Affair|journal=Newsweek|date=24 January 2005|volume=145|issue=4|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] prime-time special, ''[[Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time]]'', counted down the best films chosen by fans based on results of a poll conducted by ABC and ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]''. ''Holy Grail'' was selected as the second best comedy after ''[[Airplane!]]''.

In 2013, the Pythons lost a legal case to [[Mark Forstater]], the film's producer, over royalties for the derivative work, ''[[Spamalot]]''. They owed a combined £800,000 in legal fees and back royalties to Forstater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=John Cleese: Monty Python reunion is happening because of my £800,000 legal bill |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/john-cleese-monty-python-reunion-3591253 |quote=Last July, the Pythons lost a royalties case to Mark Forstater, who produced 1975 film Monty Python And The Holy Grail. ... |newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] |date=23 May 2014 |accessdate=28 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
