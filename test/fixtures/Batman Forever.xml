'''''Batman Forever''''' is a 1995 American [[superhero film]] directed by [[Joel Schumacher]] and produced by [[Tim Burton]], based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]]. It is the third installment of the [[Batman in film|initial ''Batman'' film series]], with [[Val Kilmer]] replacing [[Michael Keaton]] as Bruce Wayne/Batman. The film also stars [[Tommy Lee Jones]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Nicole Kidman]], and [[Chris O'Donnell]]. The plot focuses on Batman trying to stop [[Two-Face]] (Jones) and the [[Riddler]] (Carrey) in their villainous scheme to extract confidential information from all the minds in [[Gotham City]] and use it to learn Batman's identity and bring the city under their control. He gains allegiance from a love interest—psychiatrist [[List of Batman supporting characters|Dr. Chase Meridian]] (Kidman) and a young, orphaned circus acrobat named [[Dick Grayson]] (O'Donnell), who becomes his sidekick [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].

''Batman Forever''{{'}}s tone is significantly different from the previous installments, becoming more family-friendly since [[Warner Bros.]] believed that the previous ''Batman'' film, ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992), failed to outgross its predecessor due to parent complaints about the film's violence and dark overtones. Schumacher eschewed the dark, dystopian atmosphere of Burton's films by drawing inspiration from the Batman comic book of the [[Dick Sprang]] era, as well as the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s television series]]. After Keaton chose not to reprise his role, [[William Baldwin]] and [[Ethan Hawke]] were considered as a replacement before Kilmer joined the cast.

The film was released on June 16, 1995, receiving mixed reviews, with criticism towards Jones' performance as Two-Face, but was a financial success. ''Batman Forever'' grossed over $336 million worldwide and became the sixth-highest-grossing film worldwide of 1995. The film was followed by ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'' in 1997, with Schumacher returning as the director and [[George Clooney]] replacing Kilmer as Batman.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. --&gt;
In [[Gotham City]], the crime fighter [[Batman]] defuses a hostage situation caused by a criminal known as [[Two-Face]], the alter ego of the former [[district attorney]] Harvey Dent, but Two-Face escapes and remains at large. Edward Nygma, a researcher at [[Wayne Enterprises]] who idolizes Bruce Wayne, has developed a device that can beam television into a person's brain. Bruce offers to let Nygma come up with schematics for the device and set up a meeting with his assistant. However, after Nygma demands an answer from him immediately, Bruce rejects the invention, believing it to be too close to mind manipulation. After killing his supervisor and staging it as a [[suicide]], Nygma resigns and begins sending Bruce riddles, seeking retaliation against him.

Bruce meets Chase Meridian, a psychiatrist who is obsessed with Batman, and invites her to come with him to a circus event. After a performance from the circus performers, The Flying Graysons, Two-Face arrives and threatens to blow up the circus unless Batman comes forward and surrenders his life to him. The Flying Graysons attempt to stop Two-Face, but most of them get killed as a result. Only Dick Grayson, the youngest member, survives as he climbs to the roof and throws Two-Face's bomb into a river.

Bruce invites the orphaned Dick to stay at [[Wayne Manor]]. Dick, still troubled by the murder of his family, intends to kill Two-Face and avenge his family. When he discovers that Bruce is Batman, he demands that Bruce help him find Two-Face so that he can kill him, but Bruce refuses. Meanwhile, Nygma, inspired and delighted by watching Two-Face's raid at the circus, turns himself into a criminal called the [[Riddler]] and forms an alliance with Two-Face. The two steal capital in order to mass-produce Nygma's brainwave device so that Riddler can use it to learn Batman's secret identity.

At Nygma's business party, Nygma discovers Bruce's alter ego using the brainwave device. Two-Face arrives and crashes the party. He nearly kills Batman, but Dick manages to save him. Meanwhile, Chase has fallen in love with Bruce, which surpasses her obsession with Batman. Bruce decides to stop being Batman in order to have a normal life with Chase, and to prevent Dick from murdering Two-Face. Dick runs away while Bruce and Chase have dinner together in the manor, where Bruce reveals his secret identity to her. The Riddler and Two-Face arrive and attack Wayne Manor; in the process, the Riddler blows up the [[Batcave]]. The criminals kidnap Chase after Two-Face shoots Bruce, and the Riddler leaves him another riddle.

Using the riddles, Bruce and his butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]], deduce the Riddler's secret identity. Chase is imprisoned by the Riddler and Two-Face in their hideout. Dick returns and becomes Batman's sidekick, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. Batman and Robin head to Riddler and Two-Face's lair, Claw Island, where they are separated. Robin encounters Two-Face and nearly kills him, but chooses to spare his life and is captured. The Riddler gives Batman a chance to save only one hostage, but Batman destroys the Riddler's brainwave collecting device, causing the Riddler to suffer a mental breakdown and allowing Batman to rescue Robin and Chase. Two-Face corners the trio and determines their fate with the flip of a coin, but Batman throws a handful of identical coins in the air, causing Two-Face to stumble and fall to his death, avenging Robin's family.

The Riddler is taken to [[Arkham Asylum]] and imprisoned, but he claims he knows who Batman is. Chase is asked to consult on the case, but Nygma says that ''he'' himself is Batman, due to his damaged memories. Chase meets Bruce outside and tells him that his secret is safe before parting ways. Bruce resumes his crusade as Batman with Robin as his partner to protect Gotham from crime.

''[[Batman Returns]]'' was released in 1992 with financial success and generally favorable reviews from critics, but Warner Bros. was disappointed with its box office run, having made $150 million less than the first film. Director Tim Burton was asked to restrict himself to the role of producer, with approval of [[Joel Schumacher]] as director&lt;ref name=Russo&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308195,00.html |title=''Batman 3'' |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=October 1, 1993 |accessdate=August 16, 2008

And it's not just that Batman is Bruce Wayne&quot;.&lt;ref name=Batchlers&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.batman-online.com/features/2011/9/3/interview-with-batman-forever-screenwriter-janet-scott-batchler | title = Interview with Batman Forever's Janet Scott Batchler | newspaper =  | date =  | accessdate = February 11, 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130708211037/http://www.batman-online.com/features/2011/9/3/interview-with-batman-forever-screenwriter-janet-scott-batchler | archivedate = July 8, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their original script introduced a psychotic Riddler with a pet rat accompanying him. The story elements and much of the dialogue still remained in the finished film, though Schumacher felt it could be &quot;lighte[ne]d down&quot;. Schumacher claims he originally had in mind an adaptation of [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Batman: Year One]]''. Warner Bros. rejected the idea as they wanted a sequel, not a [[prequel]], though Schumacher was able to include very brief events in Bruce Wayne's childhood with some events of the comic ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]''. [[Akiva Goldsman]], who worked with Schumacher on ''[[The Client (1994 film)|The Client]]'', was brought in to rewrite the script. Burton, who was more interested in directing ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', later reflected he was taken aback by some of the [[focus group]] meetings for ''Batman Forever'', a title which he hated. Producer [[Peter MacGregor-Scott]] represented the studio's aim in making a film for the MTV Generation with full merchandising appeal.&lt;ref name=shadowbat/&gt;

Production went on fast track with [[Rene Russo]] cast as [[List of Batman supporting characters|Dr. Chase Meridian]] but [[Michael Keaton]] decided not to reprise Batman because he did not like the new direction the film series was heading in.&lt;ref name=Val&gt;{{cite news|author=Jeff Gordinier |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,302969,00.html |title=Next at ''Batman'' |newspaper=Entertainment Weekly |date=July 15, 1994 |accessdate=August 16, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921055249/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C302969%2C00.html |archivedate=September 21, 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Keaton also wanted to pursue &quot;more interesting roles&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Army Archerd]] | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862593 | title = Culkin kids ink with WMA |work = Variety | date = December 1, 1994 | accessdate = August 16, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120122065631/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862593| archivedate=January 22, 2012| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; turning down $15 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-keaton-takes-wing-in-birdman/3/|title=Michael Keaton takes wing in &quot;Birdman&quot;|publisher=CBS News|date=October 12, 2014|accessdate=October 16, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016105434/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-keaton-takes-wing-in-birdman/3/|archivedate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decision was made to go with a younger actor for Bruce Wayne, and an offer was made to [[Ethan Hawke]], who turned it down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Wiener, Jonah | url = http://www.details.com/celebrities-entertainment/movies-and-tv/201110/ethan-hawke-actor-woman-in-the-fifth | title = Q&amp;A: Ethan Hawke | work = [[Details (magazine)|Details]] | date = October 2011 | accessdate = August 7, 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130809005043/http://www.details.com/celebrities-entertainment/movies-and-tv/201110/ethan-hawke-actor-woman-in-the-fifth | archivedate = August 9, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schumacher had seen [[Val Kilmer]] in ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'', but was also interested in [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], [[Ralph Fiennes]], [[William Baldwin]], and [[Johnny Depp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jett|title=William Baldwin Talks Batman And &quot;Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths&quot;|work=Batman-on-Film|date=December 16, 2009|url=http://www.batman-on-film.com/dccomics-on-film_JL-CRISIS-ON-TWO-EARTHS_William-Baldwin-talks-Batman_12-16-09.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226075047/http://www.batman-on-film.com/dccomics-on-film_JL-CRISIS-ON-TWO-EARTHS_William-Baldwin-talks-Batman_12-16-09.html|archivedate=February 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kilmer signed on without reading the script or knowing who the new director was.&lt;ref name=hold&gt;{{cite news | author=Nathan, Ian | title=Hold me, thrill me, kiss me, Kilmer |work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | pages=108–117 | date=August 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Filming started in September 1994.&lt;ref name=Russo/&gt; Schumacher hired Barbara Ling for production design, claiming that the film needed a &quot;force&quot; and good design. Ling could &quot;advance on it&quot;. Schumacher wanted a design that was not to be in any way connected to the previous films, and instead was to be inspired by the images from the ''Batman'' comic books seen in the 1940s/early 1950s and taken from that of New York City architecture in the 1930s, with a combination of modern Tokyo. He also wanted a &quot;city with personality&quot;, with more statues, as well as various amounts of [[neon]].

Schumacher had problems filming with Kilmer, whom he described as &quot;childish and impossible&quot;, reporting that he fought with various crewmen, and refused to speak to Schumacher during two weeks after the director told him to stop behaving in a rude way.&lt;ref name=PsychoVal&gt;{{cite news|author=Rebecca Ascher-Walsh |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,292752,00.html |title=Psycho Kilmer |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=May 31, 1995 |accessdate=November 11, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201081414/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C292752%2C00.html |archivedate=December 1, 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schumacher also mentioned Tommy Lee Jones as a source of trouble: &quot;Jim Carrey was a gentleman, and Tommy Lee was threatened by him. I'm tired of defending overpaid, overprivileged actors. I pray I don't work with them again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Benjamin Svetkey |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,293237,00.html |title=Holy Happy Set! |newspaper=Entertainment Weekly |date=July 12, 1996 |accessdate=August 16, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907051616/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C293237%2C00.html |archivedate=September 7, 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrey later acknowledged Jones was not friendly to him, telling him once off-set during the production, &quot;I hate you. I really don't like you ... I cannot sanction your buffoonery.&quot;&lt;ref name=Boardman&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/tommy-lee-jones-told-jim-carrey-i-hate-you-i-really-dont-like-you-20142910 | title = ''Tommy Lee Jones Once Told Jim Carrey I Hate You, I Really Don't Like You'' | work = US Weekly | date = October 29, 2014 | accessdate = October 29, 2014  | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141029174445/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/tommy-lee-jones-told-jim-carrey-i-hate-you-i-really-dont-like-you-20142910 | archivedate = October 29, 2014 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design and effects===

[[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]] designed the [[prosthetic makeup]].

===Music===
{{further|Batman Forever (score)|Batman Forever (soundtrack)}}
[[Elliot Goldenthal]] was hired by Schumacher to compose the film score before the screenplay was written. In discussions with Schumacher, the director wanted Goldenthal to avoid taking inspiration from [[Danny Elfman]], and requested an original composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | title = Scoring Forever: The Music of Batman Forever | type =  DVD |publisher=Warner Bros.|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's promotional teaser trailer used the main title theme from Elfman's score of 1989's ''[[Batman 1989|Batman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_KllgySsPo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 27, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421201803/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_KllgySsPo |archivedate=April 21, 2015  }} Retrieved January 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The soundtrack was commercially successful, selling almost as many copies as [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s [[Batman (album)|soundtrack]] to the 1989 ''Batman'' film. Only five of the songs on the soundtrack are actually featured in the movie. Hit singles from the soundtrack include &quot;[[Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me]]&quot; by [[U2]] and &quot;[[Kiss from a Rose]]&quot; by [[Seal (musician)|Seal]], both of which were nominated for MTV Movie Awards. &quot;Kiss from a Rose&quot; (whose video was also directed by Joel Schumacher) reached No. 1 in the U.S. charts as well. The soundtrack itself, featuring additional songs by [[The Flaming Lips]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]] (both songs also included in the film), [[Method Man]], [[Nick Cave]], [[Michael Hutchence]] (of [[INXS]]), [[PJ Harvey]], and [[Massive Attack]], was an attempt to (in producer Peter MacGregor-Scott's words) make the film more &quot;pop&quot;.

==Deleted scenes==
''Batman Forever'' went through a few major edits before its release. Originally [[Evil|darker]] than the final product, the movie's original length was closer to 2 hours and 40 minutes, according to director Joel Schumacher. There was talk of an extended cut being released to DVD for the film's 10th anniversary in 2005. While all four previous ''Batman'' films were given special-edition DVD releases on the same day as the ''[[Batman Begins]]'' DVD release, none of them were given extended cuts, although some of the following scenes were in a deleted scenes section in the special features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.batman-on-film.com/opinion_scissorpuppy_forever.html | title = Batman Forever – What Could Be: A Guide to the Batman Forever Cutting Room Floor | work = Batman-On-Film.com | accessdate = December 18, 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130702174008/http://www.batman-on-film.com/opinion_scissorpuppy_forever.html | archivedate = July 2, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an undercurrent theme involving Bruce having repressed memories of an aspect of his parents' death that he hadn't faced which was finding his father's diary on the night of his parents' wake and reading that Bruce insisted his parents go to the theater so he could watch one of the shows, meaning the reason he became Batman was out of the guilt that he was responsible for their deaths.

Many scenes were filmed but deleted from the film; other scenes had footage removed. These included:

* The escape of Two-Face from Arkham Asylum. [[René Auberjonois]] had another scene filmed here in the role of Doctor Burton, but his role was reduced in the final film. He discovers Two-Face's escape, encountering his psychologist hanged in Two-Face's cell with &quot;The Bat Must Die&quot; written in blood on the wall. This was supposed to be the film's opening scene, but producers decided this was far too dark for a family audience. This scene appears in the comic adaptation and the novelization.
* When Two-Face addresses the crowd from the helicopter in the opening action scene, the speech was truncated and several lines that appeared in the Theatrical Trailer were removed, including the line &quot;If the Bat wants to play, we'll play!&quot;
* There was a sequence that contained an extended fight scene between Two-Face and Batman, where they both struggle for control of the helicopter. In this scene, Two-Face accuses Batman of being &quot;a killer too&quot;(a continuity reference to the previous Burton films). Two-face then manages to escape by the parachute, after Batman realizes he has locked the steering wheel into position. This sequence is included in rough form on the special-edition DVD.
* A scene right before Edward Nygma arrived at Wayne Manor. It featured Bruce Wayne watching a local Gotham talk show with Chase Meridian as a guest, talking about Batman.
* One scene right before Riddler and Two-face team up featured a little conversation with Dick and Bruce in the gym of the manor. This would explain why Dick suddenly has martial arts training. This scene appears in a rough edit on the special-edition DVD.
* The scene where the Riddler fails to punch a security guard out. The guard is then brutally beaten by the Riddler using his cane. 
* One sequence came directly after the casino robbery, where Batman follows a robbery signal on a tracking device in the Batmobile. He shows up at the crime scene and finds he is at the wrong place (a beauty salon), in which a room full of girls laugh at him. The Riddler had been throwing Batman off the track by messing with the Batmobile's tracking device. This would explain why in the theatrical version Batman seems to give Riddler and Two-Face moments of free rein over the city. This scene appears in a rough edit on the special-edition DVD.
* The construction of NygmaTech was after Batman solves the third riddle and was more in-depth. There were scenes shot that appear in publicity stills of Edward Nygma with a hard hat helping with the construction of his headquarters on Claw Island.
* Sugar and Spice, played by [[Drew Barrymore]] and [[Debi Mazar]], try out the Riddler's device during the montage when it goes on sale. They are seated with the Riddler and Two-Face on the couch where Chase is handcuffed later in the film. This scene appears in the comic adaptation but not in the final film.
* There was originally a scene after the montage of Alfred and Bruce examining the NygmaTech &quot;Box&quot;.
* An extended scene established Bruce in the Batcave shortly after having discussed with Dick then that this would have saved his life after the battle with Two-Face in the subway system under construction. In this scene he is appreciated as the GNN news (Bruce watching in the Batcomputer) attacking Batman and Two-Face after the battle in the Subway and after that Bruce talking to Alfred turns into the dilemma of continuing to be Batman and try a normal life with Chase. Like the deleted Helicopter fight sequence, this scene also makes reference to Batman himself being &quot;a killer&quot;, and in the original production screenplay, this scene was to contain footage from ''[[Batman Returns]]'', specifically taken from the rooftop fight scene with Catwoman. This would explain why in the theatrical version Bruce turns off all the systems in the Batcave telling Dick he gives up being Batman. This scene appears in a rough form on the special-edition DVD.
* Another scene in the Wayne Manor raid sequence was longer, featuring Bruce and Chase fighting Two-Face and his thugs.
* The scene involving Chase Meridian on the couch originally included a longer ending where the Riddler injects her with a green sleeping agent so he can easily place her in the small tube with the trap door.
* Another deleted scene involved Bruce waking up after being shot in the head by Two-Face, temporarily forgetting his origin and life as the Dark Knight. Alfred takes him to the Batcave, which has been destroyed by the Riddler. They stand on the platform where the [[Batmobile]] was, and Alfred says, &quot;Funny they did not know about the cave beneath the cave.&quot; The platform then rotates downward to another level where the [[sonar]]-modification equipment is kept, from the special [[Batsuit]] to the hi-tech weaponry. Bruce then discovers the cavern where he first saw the giant bat that inspired him to become Batman. Inside he finds his father's red diary which he had dropped when he first fell into the Batcave after his parents death. He reads the entry about him insisting his parents take him to the theater to see a show the same night they were killed. He realizes he had misread it, and his father had written 'even though Bruce insists, we wanted to see Zorro so his show will have to wait until next week'. Bruce realizes his parents death was not his fault after all. The giant bat then appears and Bruce raises his arms to match the wing anatomy of the bat and the shot shows that they are one. Bruce now remembers who he is and goes with Alfred to solve the riddles left throughout the film. Screenwriter [[Akiva Goldsman]] admitted the scene was very theatrical on the special-edition DVD and felt it would have made a difference to the final cut. The bat was designed and created by [[Rick Baker]], who was in charge of the make-up of Two-Face. This scene appears in a rough form on the special-edition DVD.
* The fight scene between Two-Face and Robin on Claw Island was originally longer.
* The original ending was similar in style to the previous Batman films, which had involved a scene with Alfred in the limousine, the camera tracking upward through the Gotham cityscape, followed by a rooftop shot involving a silhouetted hero (Batman in the original, Catwoman in ''[[Batman Returns]]'') facing the Bat Signal. When Alfred drives Doctor Chase Meridian back to Gotham she asks him &quot;Does it ever end, Alfred?&quot; Alfred replies, &quot;No, Doctor Meridian, not in this lifetime...&quot; The [[Bat-Signal]] shines on the night sky and Batman is standing on a pillar looking ahead. Robin then comes into shot and joins his new partner. They both leap off the pillar, towards the camera. A rough edit of the first half of the scene appears on the special-edition DVD, but not in its entirety.

==Release==

===Box office===
''Batman Forever'' opened in 2,842 theaters in the United States on June 16, 1995, making $52.8 million in its opening weekend,&lt;ref name=&quot;Box&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Batman Forever (1995) |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=batmanforever.htm |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=August 16, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216144714/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=batmanforever.htm |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; breaking [[Jurassic Park (film)|''Jurassic Park'']]'s record for highest opening-weekend gross of all time (it was surpassed two years later by ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]''{{'}}s $72.1 million).&lt;ref name=&quot;dom&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=releasedate&amp;view=opening&amp;yr=1995&amp;p=.htm | title = 1995 Domestic Grosses | publisher = Box Office Mojo | accessdate = August 16, 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130523024352/http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=releasedate&amp;view=opening&amp;yr=1995&amp;p=.htm | archivedate = May 23, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film went on to gross $184 million in North America, and $152.5 million in other countries, totaling $336.53 million.

===Critical reaction {{anchor|Critics}}===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 40% based on 62 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, &quot;Loud, excessively busy, and often boring, ''Batman Forever'' nonetheless has the charisma of Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones to offer mild relief.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_forever/ | title = Batman Forever | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher = [[Fandango Media]] | accessdate = July 5, 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130811193353/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_forever/ | archivedate = August 11, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 51 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/movie/batman-forever | title = Batman Forever (1995): Reviews | work = [[Metacritic]] | publisher = [[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate = August 16, 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130316015850/http://www.metacritic.com/movie/batman-forever | archivedate = March 16, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of &quot;A–&quot; on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;CinemaScore&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= https://cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= CinemaScore |work= [[CinemaScore]] |access-date= October 14, 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180722041238/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= July 22, 2018 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Travers]] of ''Rolling Stone'' said &quot;''Batman Forever'' still gets in its licks. There's no fun machine this summer that packs more surprises.&quot; However, he criticized the film's excessive commercialism and felt that &quot;the script misses the pain [[Tim Burton]] caught in a man tormented by the long-ago murder of his parents&quot; seeing the Bruce Wayne of Kilmer as &quot;inexpressive&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Peter Travers]] | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5948895/review/5948896/batman_forever | title = Batman Forever | work = [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] | date = December 8, 2000 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080708013413/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5948895/review/5948896/batman_forever | archivedate = July 8, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' believed &quot;One does have to question the logic behind adding nipples to the hard-rubber [[batsuit]]. Whose idea was that supposed to be anyway, [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]]'s? Some of the [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] [[Gotham City|Gotham]] cityscapes appear too obviously fake. [[Elliot Goldenthal]]'s score, while serviceable, also isn't as stirring as [[Danny Elfman]]'s work in the first two films.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Brian Lowry | url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117904172.html | title = Batman Forever |work = Variety | date = June 14, 1995 | accessdate = August 16, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080821175815/http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117904172.html| archivedate= August 21, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Berardinelli]] of ''ReelViews'' enjoyed the film. &quot;It's lighter, brighter, funnier, faster-paced, and a whole lot more colorful than before.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/b/batman3.html|title=''Batman Forever''|author=[[James Berardinelli]]|first=|date=June 16, 1995|work=ReelViews|accessdate=August 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scott Beatty]] felt &quot;Tommy Lee Jones played [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] as a [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] knock-off rather than a multi-layered rogue.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Bill &quot;Jett&quot; Ramey | url = http://batman-on-film.com/sbeattyinterview.html | title = BOF Interview: Scott Beatty | work = Batman-on-Film | date = November 28, 2005 | accessdate = August 16, 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110707193850/http://batman-on-film.com/sbeattyinterview.html | archivedate = July 7, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lee Bermejo]] called ''Batman Forever'' &quot;unbearable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Bill &quot;Jett&quot; Ramey | url = http://batman-on-film.com/leebermejointerview.html | title = Interview: Lee Bermejo | work = Batman-on-Film | date = October 13, 2005 | accessdate = August 16, 2008 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080915114140/http://www.batman-on-film.com/leebermejointerview.html | archivedate = September 15, 2008 | deadurl = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' both gave the film mixed reviews, but with the former giving it a [[Thumb signal|thumbs up]] and the latter a [[Thumb signal|thumbs down]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert|url=http://siskelandebert.org/video/GYHONHY3SB3D/Batman-Forever--Smoke--2-Girls-in-Love-1995|title=Batman Forever / Smoke / 2 Girls in Love (1995)|work=Siskel &amp; Ebert.org|accessdate=December 22, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223090150/http://siskelandebert.org/video/GYHONHY3SB3D/Batman-Forever--Smoke--2-Girls-in-Love-1995|archivedate=December 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his written review, Ebert wrote: &quot;Is the movie better entertainment?

===Merchandising===
In addition to a large line of toys and [[action figure]]s from [[Kenner]], the [[McDonald's]] food chain released several collectibles and mugs to coincide with the release of the film. [[Peter David]] and [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] wrote separate [[novelization]]s of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316324183 | title = Batman Forever (Paperback) |publisher= [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] | accessdate = August 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.amazon.com/dp/0446602175 | title = Batman Forever: The Novelization |publisher=Amazon| accessdate = August 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dennis O'Neil]] authored a comic book adaptation, with art by [[Michal Dutkiewicz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.amazon.com/dp/1563891999 | title = Batman Forever: The Official Comic Adaptation of Motion Picture |publisher=Amazon| accessdate = August 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Six Flags Great Adventure]] theme park re-themed their &quot;Axis Chemical&quot; arena, home of the Batman stunt show, to resemble &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, and the new show featured props from the film. Because of the mostly negative critical reaction however, the stunt arena was changed back to its original version after the season. [[Six Flags Over Texas]] featured a one-time fireworks show to promote the movie, and replica busts of Batman, Robin, Two-Face, and the Riddler can still be found in the Justice League store in the Looney Tunes U.S.A. section.
