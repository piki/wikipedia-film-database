'''Werner Herzog''' ({{IPA-de|ˈvɛɐ̯nɐ ˈhɛɐ̯tsoːk|lang}}; born 5 September 1942) is a German film director, screenwriter, author, actor, and opera director. Herzog is a figure of the [[New German Cinema]]. His films often feature ambitious [[protagonist]]s with impossible dreams,&lt;ref name=&quot;empireonline&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/40-great-actor-director-partnerships/default.asp?c=35 |title=40 Great Actor &amp; Director Partnerships: Klaus Kinski &amp; Werner Herzog |accessdate=June 19, 2010|work=Empire Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; people with unique talents in obscure fields, or individuals who are in conflict with nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;thedailystar.net&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Mahmud |first=Jamil |date=September 30, 2009 |title=Werner Herzog and his film language |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=107680 |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |accessdate=June 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Werner Herzog made his first film in 1961 at the age of 19. Since then he has produced, written, and directed more than sixty feature- and documentary films, such as [[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]] (1972), [[Nosferatu the Vampyre]] (1978), [[Fitzcarraldo]] (1982), [[Lessons of Darkness]] (1992), [[Little Dieter Needs to Fly]] (1997), [[My Best Fiend]] (1999), [[Invincible_(2001_drama_film)|Invincible]] (2000), [[Grizzly Man]] (2005), [[Encounters at the End of the World]] (2007), [[Cave of Forgotten Dreams]] (2010). He has published more than a dozen books of prose, and directed as many operas.

French filmmaker [[François Truffaut]] once called Herzog &quot;the most important film director alive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cronin | first = Paul |author2=Werner Herzog  | title = Herzog on Herzog | publisher = Faber and Faber Limited | year = 2002 | location = London | pages = vii–viii | isbn = 978-0-571-20708-4 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ydN_2oj8M0wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Herzog+on+Herzog&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FZ9QTeXfBsTJgQeErZywCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDkQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=truffaut&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; American film critic [[Roger Ebert]] said that Herzog &quot;has never created a single film that is compromised, shameful, made for pragmatic reasons, or uninteresting. Even his failures are spectacular.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, Roger (2006). ''Awake in the Dark: The Best of Roger Ebert'', University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|0226182002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Herzog was born Werner Stipetić in [[Munich]], to Elizabeth Stipetić, an [[Austria]]n of [[Croatia]]n descent, and Dietrich Herzog, who was German. When Werner was two weeks old, his mother took refuge in the remote Bavarian village of [[Sachrang]] (in the [[Chiemgau Alps]]), after the house next to theirs was destroyed during a bombing raid in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news |title=Werner Herzog on the Story Behind 'Rescue Dawn' |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11782309 |quote= |publisher=[[Fresh Air]] |date=October 27, 1998 |accessdate=June 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sachrang, Herzog grew up without running water, a flushing toilet, or a telephone. He never saw films, and did not even know of the existence of cinema until a traveling projectionist came by the one-room schoolhouse in Sachrang.&lt;ref name=&quot;Werner Herzog: A Guide for the Perplexed: Conversations with Paul Cronin&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Cronin | first= Paul |title = Werner Herzog: A Guide for the Perplexed: Conversations with Paul Cronin | publisher = Faber and Faber Limited |year = 2014 |isbn = 978-0571259779 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Werner-Herzog-Perplexed-Conversations-Cronin/dp/0571259774/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1434000762&amp;sr=8-9&amp;keywords=the+guide+to+the+perplexed}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Herzog was 12, he and his family moved back to Munich. His father had abandoned the family early in his youth. Werner later adopted his father's surname ''Herzog'' (German for &quot;duke&quot;), which he thought sounded more impressive for a filmmaker.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laster&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Laster |first=Paul |url=http://www.observer.com/2011/05/werner-herzog-comes-out-of-the-cave/ |title=Werner Herzog Comes Out of the Cave |work=New York Observer |date=July 25, 2011 |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, Herzog was told to sing in front of his class at school, and he adamantly refused, and was almost expelled. Until he was age eighteen, Herzog listened to no music, sang no songs, and studied no instruments. He later said that he would easily give ten years from his life to be able to play the cello. At an early age, he experienced a dramatic phase in which he converted to Catholicism, which only lasted a few years. He started to embark on long journeys, some of them on foot. Around this time, he knew he would be a filmmaker, and learned the basics from a few pages in an encyclopedia which provided him with &quot;everything I needed to get myself started&quot; as a filmmaker—that, and the [[Movie camera|35 mm camera]] he stole from the Munich Film School.&lt;ref name=&quot;bissell&quot;&gt;Bissell, Tom. &quot;The Secret Mainstream: Contemplating the mirages of Werner Herzog&quot;, ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'', December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In the commentary for ''[[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]]'', he says, &quot;I don't consider it theft. It was just a necessity. I had some sort of natural right for a camera, a tool to work with&quot;. He won a scholarship to [[Duquesne University]] and lasted only a few days, but lived in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. During his last years of high school, no production company was willing to take on his projects, so Herzog worked night shifts as a welder in a steel factory to earn the funds for his first featurettes. After graduating from high school, he was intrigued by the Congo after its independence, but only reached the south of the Sudan where he fell seriously ill.

While already making films, he had a brief stint at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich University]], where he studied history and literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wishmachinery.com/2017/11/does-werner-herzog-have-college-degree.html|title=Does Werner Herzog Have a College Degree? Answer|website=www.wishmachinery.com|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He earned money by participating in preproduction of a documentary for [[NASA]] with [[KQED (TV)|KQED]]. Summoned to the immigration office because of a violation of his visa status, he chose to flee to Mexico.

Before leaving school, he bought a house in the UK, in what was likely the [[Moss Side]] area of [[Manchester]]. There he learned to speak English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cronin | first = Paul |author2=Werner Herzog  | title = Herzog on Herzog | publisher = Faber and Faber Limited |year = 2002 | location = London | pages = 1–2 | isbn = 978-0-571-20708-4 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ydN_2oj8M0wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Herzog+on+Herzog&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FZ9QTeXfBsTJgQeErZywCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDkQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=truffaut&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, he made his first short film, Herakles. In school there was an emphasis on Latin and Greek, in which he continues to read to this day.

In 1971, while Herzog was [[location scouting]] for ''[[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]]'' in Peru, he narrowly avoided taking [[LANSA Flight 508]]. Herzog's reservation was cancelled due to a last-minute change in itinerary. The plane was later struck by lightning and disintegrated, but one survivor, [[Juliane Koepcke]], lived after a free fall. Long haunted by the event, nearly 30 years later he made a documentary film, ''[[Wings of Hope (documentary)|Wings of Hope]]'' (2000), which explored the story of the sole survivor.

==Career==
[[File:WERNER HERZOG star.jpg|thumb|Werner Herzog's star on the ''Boulevard der Stars'' in Berlin.]]

Herzog, along with [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] and [[Volker Schlöndorff]], led the beginning of the West German cinema movement. The West German cinema movement consisted of documentarians that filmed on low budgets and were influenced by the French New Wave of cinema.

Besides using professional actors—German, American and otherwise—Herzog is known for using people from the locality in which he is shooting. Especially in his documentaries, he uses locals to benefit what he calls &quot;ecstatic truth&quot; (as opposed to the literal or factual truth). He uses footage of the non-actors both playing roles and being themselves.

Herzog and his films have been nominated for and won many awards. His first major award was the [[Jury Grand Prix|Silver Bear Extraordinary Prize of the Jury]] for his first feature film ''[[Signs of Life (1968 film)|Signs of Life]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;berlinale
 1968&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1968/03_preistr_ger_1968/03_Preistraeger_1968.html |title=Berlinale 1968: Prize Winners |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[Nosferatu the Vampyre]]'' was also nominated for Golden Bear in 1979). Most notably, Herzog won the best director award for ''[[Fitzcarraldo]]'' at the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival]]. In 1975, his movie ''[[The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser]]'' won the ''[[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix Spécial du Jury]]'' (also known as the 'Silver Palm') at the Cannes Festival. Other films directed by Herzog nominated for Golden Palm are: ''[[Woyzeck (1979 film)|Woyzeck]]'' (1979) and ''[[Where the Green Ants Dream]]'' (1984).

His films have been nominated at many other important festivals around the world: [[César Awards]] (''[[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]]''), [[Emmy Awards]] (''[[Little Dieter Needs to Fly]]''), [[European Film Awards]] (''[[My Best Fiend]]'') and [[Venice Film Festival]] (''[[Scream of Stone]]'' and ''[[The Wild Blue Yonder]]'').

In 1987, Herzog and his half-brother [[Lucki Stipetić]] won the [[Bayerischer Filmpreis|Bavarian Film Award]] for Best Producing for the film ''[[Cobra Verde]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bayern.de/Anlage19170/PreistraegerdesBayerischenFilmpreises-Pierrot.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325165025/http://www.bayern.de/Anlage19170/PreistraegerdesBayerischenFilmpreises-Pierrot.pdf|date=March 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 he won the ''Dragon of Dragons Honorary Award'' during [[Kraków Film Festival]] in [[Kraków]].

In 1999, before a public dialogue with critic [[Roger Ebert]] at the [[Walker Art Center]], Herzog read a new [[manifesto]], which he dubbed Minnesota Declaration: Truth and Fact in Documentary Cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://walkerart.org/magazine/minnesota-declaration-truth-documentary-cinema |title=Werner Herzog Reads His Minnesota Declaration: Truth and Fact in Documentary Cinema |publisher=[[Walker Art Center]] |date=April 30, 1999 |accessdate=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subtitled &quot;Lessons of Darkness,&quot; the 12-point declaration began: &quot;Cinema Verité is devoid of verité. It reaches a merely superficial truth, the truth of accountants.&quot; Ebert later wrote of its significance: “For the first time, it fully explained his theory of ‘ecstatic truth.’”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/herzogs-minnesota-declaration-defining-ecstatic-truth |title=HERZOG'S MINNESOTA DECLARATION: DEFINING 'ECSTATIC TRUTH' |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=April 30, 1999 |accessdate=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Herzog wrote a six-point addendum to the manifesto,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://walkerart.org/magazine/werner-herzog-minnesota-declaration-2017-addendum |title=Werner Herzog Makes Trump-Era Addition to His Minnesota Declaration |publisher=[[Walker Art Center]] |date=Jun 19, 2017  |accessdate=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompted by a question about &quot;truth in an age of alt-facts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://walkerart.org/magazine/series/what-is-truth-in-an-age-of-alternative-facts |title=What is Truth in an Age of Alternative Facts |publisher=[[Walker Art Center]] |date=Jun 19, 2017  |accessdate=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herzog was honored at the 49th [[San Francisco International Film Festival]], receiving the 2006 Film Society Directing Award.&lt;ref name=&quot;festival-cannes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fest06.sffs.org/awards/werner_herzog.php |title=Film Society Directing Award |accessdate=April 8, 2009|work=sffs.org |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080527080736/http://fest06.sffs.org/awards/werner_herzog.php |archivedate = May 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four of his films have been shown at the San Francisco International Film Festival: ''[[Wodaabe - Herdsmen of the Sun]]'' in 1990, ''[[Bells from the Deep]]'' in 1993, ''[[Lessons of Darkness]]'' in 1993, and ''[[The Wild Blue Yonder]]'' in 2006. Herzog's April 2007 appearance at the [[Ebertfest]] in Champaign, Illinois earned him the Golden Thumb Award, and an engraved [[glockenspiel]] given to him by a young film maker inspired by his films. ''[[Grizzly Man]]'', directed by Herzog, won the [[Alfred P. Sloan Prize]] at the 2005 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. ''[[Encounters at the End of the World]]'' won the award for Best Documentary at the 2008 [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]], Herzog's first nomination.

Herzog once promised to eat his shoe if [[Errol Morris]] completed the movie project on pet cemeteries that he had been working on, in order to challenge and motivate Morris, whom Herzog perceived as incapable of following up on the projects he conceived. In 1978, when the film ''[[Gates of Heaven]]'' premiered, Werner Herzog cooked and publicly ate his shoe, an event later incorporated into a short documentary ''[[Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe]]'' by [[Les Blank]]. At the event, Herzog suggested that he hoped the act would serve to encourage anyone having difficulty bringing a project to fruition.

In 2009, Herzog became the only filmmaker in recent history to enter two films in competition in the same year at the prestigious [[Venice Film Festival]]. Herzog's ''[[The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans]]'' was entered into the festival's official competition schedule, and his ''[[My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done?]]'' entered the competition as a &quot;surprise film&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/filmNews/idUSTRE5841N320090905 |title=Filmmaker Herzog is up against himself in Venice &amp;#124; Film |publisher=Reuters |date=September 5, 2009 |accessdate=October 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herzog also provided the narration for the short film [[Plastic Bag (film)|''Plastic Bag'']] directed by [[Ramin Bahrani]] which was the opening night film in the Corto Cortissimo section of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/festival/lineup/official_selection/corto_cortissimo/bag.html |title=66th Venice Film Festival Corto Cortissimo |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006065315/http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/festival/lineup/official_selection/corto_cortissimo/bag.html |archivedate=October 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dissatisfied with the way film schools are run, Herzog founded his own [http://www.roguefilmschool.com Rogue Film School] in 2009. The program is a 4-day seminar with Herzog, which occurs annually (the last of which was held in March, 2016 in Munich). Courses include &quot;the art of lockpicking. Traveling on foot. The exhilaration of being shot at unsuccessfully. The athletic side of filmmaking. The creation of your own shooting permits. The neutralization of bureaucracy. Guerrilla tactics. Self reliance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.roguefilmschool.com/about.asp|title=Werner Herzog's Rogue Film School|website=www.roguefilmschool.com|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the students, Herzog has said, &quot;I prefer people who have worked as bouncers in a sex club, or have been wardens in the lunatic asylum. You must live life in its very elementary forms. The Costa Ricans have a very nice word for it: ''pura vida''. It doesn’t mean just purity of life, but the raw, stark-naked quality of life. And that’s what makes young people more into a filmmaker than academia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beggs|first=Scott|url=http://filmschoolrejects.com/features/6-filmmaking-tips-from-werner-herzog.php |title=6 FILMMAKING TIPS FROM WERNER HERZOG |publisher=[[Film School Rejects]] |date=September 12, 2012 |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herzog was the president of the jury at the [[60th Berlin International Film Festival]] in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlinale 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/presse/pressemitteilungen/alle/Alle-Detail_5364.html |title=Werner Herzog to be President of the Jury of the 60th Berlinale |accessdate=December 22, 2009 |work=berlinale.de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125161234/http://www.berlinale.de/en/presse/pressemitteilungen/alle/Alle-Detail_5364.html |archivedate=November 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thelocal.de&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.de/society/20091119-23385.html |title=Werner Herzog to head Berlin film festival jury |accessdate=December 22, 2009 |work=thelocal.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BerlinBBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8370440.stm |title=Werner Herzog is to head the Berlin Film Festival jury |accessdate=December 22, 2009 |work=bbc news | date=November 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herzog completed a documentary called ''[[Cave of Forgotten Dreams]]'' in 2010, which shows his journey into the [[Chauvet Cave]] in France. Although generally skeptical of [[3-D film]] as a format,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planet-mag.com/2010/features/alex-shephard/werner-herzog-interview/ |title=Werner Herzog Interview &amp;#124; PLANET° |publisher=Planet-mag.com |date=September 7, 2010 |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herzog premiered the film at the [[2010 Toronto International Film Festival]] in 3-D and had its European premiere at the 2011 Berlinale. Also in 2010, Herzog co-directed with Dimitry Vasuykov ''[[Happy People: A Year in the Taiga]]'', which portrays the life of fur [[Siberian fur trade|trapper]]s from the [[Siberia]]n part of the [[Taiga]], and had its premiere at the 2010 [[Telluride Film Festival]].

Herzog has narrated many of his documentary films, and he lent his voice to an animated television program for the first time in 2010, appearing in ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]'' in its third-season premiere episode ''[[It's a Black President, Huey Freeman]]''. In the episode, he played a fictionalized version of himself filming a documentary about the series' cast of characters and their actions during the 2008 election of [[Barack Obama]].

Continuing with voice work, Herzog played Walter Hotenhoffer (formerly known as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Augustus Gloop|Augustus Gloop]]) in the Simpsons episode ''[[The Scorpion's Tale]]'' which aired in March 2011. The next year, he also appeared in the [[American Dad! (season 8)|8th-season]] episode of ''[[American Dad!]]'' called &quot;[[Ricky Spanish]]&quot;, and lent his voice to a recurring character during the [[Metalocalypse (season 4)|4th season]] of the [[Adult Swim]] animated series ''[[Metalocalypse]]''. In 2015 he voiced a character for Adult Swim's ''[[Rick and Morty]]''. He also appeared opposite [[Tom Cruise]] as the villain Zec Chelovek in the 2012 action film ''[[Jack Reacher (film)|Jack Reacher]]''.

Herzog gained attention in 2013 when he released a 35-minute [[Public Service Announcement]]-style documentary, ''From One Second to the Next'', demonstrating the danger of texting while driving and financed by [[AT&amp;T]], [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]], [[Verizon]], and [[T-Mobile]] as part of their ''It Can Wait'' driver safety campaign. The film, which documents four stories in which texting and driving led to tragedy or death, initially received over 1.7 million YouTube views and was subsequently distributed to over 40,000 high schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leopold|first=Todd|title=Film legend Herzog takes on texting and driving|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/16/tech/mobile/werner-herzog-texting-driving/|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=August 16, 2013|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, Herzog contributed to an art installation entitled &quot;Hearsay of the Soul&quot;, for the Whitney Biennial, which was later acquired as a permanent exhibit by the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] in Los Angeles. In late 2013 he also lent his voice to the English-language dub of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[The Wind Rises]]''.

In 2011, Herzog competed with [[Ridley Scott]] for making a film based around the life of explorer [[Gertrude Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dang|first=Simon|title=Watch Out, Ridley: Werner Herzog's Gertrude Bell Film Starring Naomi Watts Hoping To Shoot In The Fall|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/watch-out-ridley-werner-herzogs-gertrude-bell-film-starring-naomi-watt-hoping-to-shoot-in-the-fall-20120520|publisher=IndieWire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, it was confirmed that Herzog would start production on his long-in-development project in March 2013 in [[Morocco]] with [[Naomi Watts]] to play Gertrude Bell along with [[Robert Pattinson]] to play [[T. E. Lawrence]] and [[Jude Law]] to play [[Henry Cadogan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chitwood|first=Adam|title=Jude Law Joins Robert Pattinson and Naomi Watts in Werner Herzog’s QUEEN OF THE DESERT|url=http://collider.com/jude-law-queen-of-the-desert/208459/|publisher=Collider|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was completed in 2014 with a different cast: [[Nicole Kidman]] as Gertrude Bell, [[James Franco]] as Henry Cadogan, [[Damian Lewis]] as Charles Doughty-Wylie, and [[Robert Pattinson]] as a 22-year-old archaeologist [[T. E. Lawrence]]. '' [[Queen of the Desert (film)|Queen of the Desert]]'' had its world premiere at the 2015 [[Berlin International Film Festival]].

In 2015, Herzog shot a feature film, ''Salt and Fire'', in [[Bolivia]], starring [[Veronica Ferres]], [[Michael Shannon]] and [[Gael García Bernal]]. It is described as a &quot;highly explosive drama inspired by a short story by [[Tom Bissell]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raup|first=Jordan|title=Gael García Bernal Join Werner Herzog’s ‘Salt and Fire’|url=http://thefilmstage.com/news/michael-shannon-and-gael-garcia-bernal-join-werner-herzogs-salt-and-fire/|publisher=The Film Stage|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Herzog released an online masterclass sharing in-depth knowledge of his craft entitled ''Werner Herzog teaches filmmaking''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/99091-i-tried-not-to-be-didactic-werner-herzog-masterclass/|title=“I Tried Not to Be Didactic”: Werner Herzog on His MasterClass {{!}} Filmmaker Magazine|last=|first=|date=|work=Filmmaker Magazine|access-date=2018-02-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film theory==
Herzog's films have received considerable critical acclaim and achieved popularity on the [[art house]] circuit. They have also been the subject of controversy in regard to their themes and messages, especially the circumstances surrounding their creation. A notable example is ''[[Fitzcarraldo]]'', in which the obsessiveness of the central character was reflected by the director during the making of the film. ''[[Burden of Dreams]]'', a documentary filmed during the making of ''Fitzcarraldo'', explored Herzog's efforts to make the film in harsh conditions. Herzog's diaries during the making of ''Fitzcarraldo'' were published as ''Conquest of the Useless: Reflections from the Making of Fitzcarraldo.'' [[Mark Harris (journalist)|Mark Harris]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote in his review: &quot;The movie and its making are both fables of daft aspiration, investigations of the blurry border between having a dream and losing one’s mind.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/02/books/review/Harris-t.html |title=Book Review {{!}} 'Conquest of the Useless: Reflections From the Making of ‘Fitzcarraldo’,' by Werner Herzog|last=Harris|first=Mark|date=2009-07-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His treatment of subjects has been characterized as [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] in its scope. The plot of ''Fitzcarraldo'' is based on the building of an opera house and his later film ''[[Invincible (2001 drama film)|Invincible]]'' (2001) touches on the character of [[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/1753|title=BFI - Sight &amp; Sound - Film of the Month: Invincible (2001)|first=The British Film|last=Institute|website=old.bfi.org.uk|accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is proud of never using [[storyboard]]s and often improvising large parts of the script. He explains this technique in the commentary track to ''[[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]]''.

==Collaborations==
Herzog has preferred to develop a team to work with, both of actors and technical people. He has gathered a group who [see below] have appeared in numerous films. Additionally, Herzog was co-executive producer along with [[Errol Morris]] on [[Joshua Oppenheimer| Joshua Oppenheimer’s]] documentary film, ''[[The Act of Killing]]'', which reported on the mass slayings that took [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965–1966|place in Indonesia in 1965 and 1966]], following the overthrow of Indonesia's first president, [[Sukarno]] by anti-communists of suspected communists and interviewed a number of its perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/movies/the-act-of-killing-and-indonesian-death-squads.html|title=‘The Act of Killing’ and Indonesian Death Squads|first=Larry|last=Rohter|date=July 12, 2013|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crew===

====Cinematographers====
[[Thomas Mauch]] worked with Herzog on ten films: starting with ''Signs of Life'' and ''Last Words'' and ending with ''Fitzcarraldo''. He helped to create hallucinogenic atmosphere in ''Aguirre'' and the realistic style of ''Stroszek''. Mauch won Film Award in Gold and National Society of Film Critics Awards for ''Aguirre''.

[[Jörg Schmidt-Reitwein]] worked with Herzog on seventeen films. Reitwein was Thomas Mauch's assistant camera during ''Even Dwarfs Started Small''. His first independent work for Herzog was ''Precautions Against Fanatics'' in 1969.

[[Peter Zeitlinger]] collaborated with Herzog on more than twenty films, from ''[[Gesualdo: Death for Five Voices]]'' (1995) to the documentary ''[[Into the Inferno (film)|Into the Inferno]]'' (2017), including ''[[Rescue Dawn]]'' and ''[[Grizzly Man]]''. He was nominated for the [[Independent Spirit Award]] for ''[[Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans]]'' in 2009. He also photographed  ''[[Encounters at the End of the World]]'' which was nominated for the [[Academy Award]].

====Producers====
Walter Saxer produced sixteen of Herzog's films, including ''Nosferatu'' and ''The White Diamond''. He worked in the Sound Department during seven of Herzog's films, including ''The Great Ecstasy of Woodcarver Steiner'' and ''Echoes from a Somber Empire''. He co-wrote ''Scream of Stone'' which Herzog directed. Saxer appeared as himself in Herzog's ''My Best Fiend'' and in Les Blank's ''Burden of Dreams'', in which he was also subjected to the verbal abuse of Kinski.

[[Lucki Stipetić]] is Herzog's half-brother, and he produced several Herzog films, including ''Aguirre'' and ''Invincible''. He is a head of Werner Herzog Productions. He won the [[Bavarian Film Award]] in 1988 for ''Cobra Verde'' and International Documentary Association Award for ''Little Dieter Needs to Fly'' in 1998. He was also nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] in 1998.

Ann Poppel collaborated with Herzog on four films, including ''Nosferatu the Vampyre'' and ''Scream of Stone''. Gisela Storch worked with Herzog on six films: ''The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser'', ''Heart of Glass'', ''Nosferatu the Vampyre'', ''Woyzeck'', ''Fitzcarraldo'' and ''Cobra Verde''. She was nominated for a Saturn Award for ''Nosferatu the Vampyre'' in 1979.

====Composers====
German [[Krautrock]] band [[Popol Vuh (German band)|Popol Vuh]], founded by pianist and keyboardist Florian Fricke, have composed music for eight of Herzog's films: ''Aguirre, the Wrath of God'', ''The Great Ecstasy of Woodcarver Steiner'', ''Heart of Glass'', ''Nosferatu'', ''The Dark Glow of the Mountains'', ''Fitzcarraldo'', ''Cobra Verde'' and ''My Best Fiend''. Their compositions were also used by Herzog in ''Rescue Dawn''. Florian Fricke made a cameo as a pianist in ''Signs of Life'' and ''The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser''. The band took its name from the ''Popol Vuh,'' a manuscript of the Quiché [[Maya peoples|Maya]] kingdom. They had seen Herzog's ''Fata Morgana'', in which [[Lotte Eisner]] reads parts of the ''Popol Vuh.''

Since 2001 and the passing of Florian Fricke, for orchestral scores Herzog has mostly chosen [[Klaus Badelt]]. The first of so far four collaborations, ''Invincible'' (2001) was actually one of Badelt's first film scores. Badelt also wrote the scores to ''Rescue Dawn'' (2006), ''Happy People: A Year in the Taiga'' (2010), and is currently working on Herzog's upcoming feature ''Queen of the Desert'' (2015).

Herzog has invited [[Ernst Reijseger]] to compose scores to five of his films. Two were documentaries (''The White Diamond'' and ''Cave of Forgotten Dreams'') and three were features (''The Wild Blue Yonder'', ''My Son, My Son What Have Ye Done'', and ''Salt and Fire''). His music was also used in ''Rescue Dawn'' and in a video documentary about recording music for ''Grizzly Man.'' It was entitled ''In the Edges: The 'Grizzly Man' Session'' directed by Erik Nelson. Reijseger also had a cameo in ''My Son, My Son What Have Ye Done''.

Gierke shot additional still photographs on ''Stroszek''{{'}}s set. He appeared twice in Herzog's film ''The Transformation of the World Into Music'' as himself and in Herzog's TV realisation of the opera ''Giovanna d'Arco''. Von Gierke won the Film Award in Gold for ''The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser'' at the German Film Awards and the [[Silver Bear|Silver Bear for an outstanding single achievement]] for ''Nosferatu'', at the [[29th Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;berlinale 1978&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1979/03_preistr_ger_1979/03_Preistraeger_1979.html |title=Berlinale 1978: Prize Winners |accessdate=August 15, 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herzog is an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Herzog is an avowed atheist, but in a certain sense his films, especially in recent years, have become highly spiritual in focus. Thanks to its subject and its characters “Into the Abyss” is suffused with a Christian religiosity that the director treats with great respect.&quot; Andrew O'Hehir, ''Salon.com'', November 11, 2011. [http://www.salon.com/topic/werner_herzog/]&lt;/ref&gt;
