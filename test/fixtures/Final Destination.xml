'''''Final Destination''''' is an American [[horror film|horror]] [[Media franchise|franchise]] composed of five films, two comic books, and nine novels. It is based on an unproduced [[spec script]] by [[Jeffrey Reddick]], originally written for ''[[The X-Files]]'' television series, and was distributed by [[New Line Cinema]]. All five films center around a small group of people who escape impending death when one individual (the protagonist of each film) has a sudden [[Precognition|premonition]] and warns them that they will all die in a terrible [[mass-casualty incident|mass-casualty accident]]. After avoiding their foretold deaths, the survivors are killed one by one in bizarre accidents caused by an unseen force creating complicated chains of cause and effect, resembling [[Rube Goldberg machine]]s in their complexity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Conrich|first1=Ian|title=Puzzles, Contraptions and the Highly Elaborate Moment: The Inevitability of Death in the Grand Slasher Narratives of the Final Destination and Saw Series of Films|journal=Style and Form in the Hollywood Slasher Film|date=2015|pages=106–117|doi=10.1057/9781137496478_8|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, London|language=en|isbn=978-1-137-49646-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then read omens sent by another unseen entity in order to again avert their deaths. 

The series is noteworthy among other films in the horror genre in that the antagonist is not a stereotypical slasher or other physical being, but [[Death (personification)|Death]] personified, subtly manipulating circumstances in the environment with a design on claiming anyone who escapes their fated demise.

In addition to the films, a novel series, which includes the novelizations of the first three films, was published throughout 2005 and 2006 by [[Black Flame (publisher)|Black Flame]]. A one-shot comic book titled ''Final Destination: Sacrifice'' was released alongside select DVDs of ''Final Destination 3'' in 2006, and a comic book series titled ''Final Destination: Spring Break'' was published by [[Zenescope Entertainment]] in 2007.

==Background==
''Final Destination'' was written by [[Jeffrey Reddick]] after having &quot;read a story about a woman who was on vacation and her mom called her and said, 'Don't take the flight tomorrow, I have a really bad feeling about it.'&quot;. The woman switched flights and the plane she was originally supposed to take crashed. Originally having written the script as an episode of ''[[The X Files]]'', Reddick decided to turn the script into a feature-length film at the behest of one of his [[New Line Cinema]] colleagues. After reading his spec script, New Line Cinema hired Reddick to write the screenplay; [[James Wong (filmmaker)|James Wong]] and [[Glen Morgan]] were later brought on board to help with the script, making alterations to comply with their standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Albin |first1=Andrea |title=[Special Feature] 'Final Destination': Not So Final After All! |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/25828/special-feature-final-destination-not-so-final-after-all/ |publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |access-date=14 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042727/http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/25828/special-feature-final-destination-not-so-final-after-all/ |archive-date=4 March 2016 |date=12 August 2011 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the original ''Final Destination'', high school student [[Alex Browning]] ([[Devon Sawa]]) boards Volee Airlines Flight 180 with his classmates for a field trip to [[Paris]], France. Before take-off, Alex has a premonition that the plane will explode in mid-air, killing everyone on board. When the events from his vision begin to repeat themselves in reality, he panics, and a fight breaks out, which leads to several passengers being left behind, including [[Clear Rivers]] ([[Ali Larter]]), Carter Horton ([[Kerr Smith]]), Billy Hitchcock ([[Seann William Scott]]), Valerie Lewton ([[Kristen Cloke]]), Terry Chaney ([[Amanda Detmer]]), and Tod Waggner ([[Chad Donella]]), who witness the plane explode moments later. Afterwards, the survivors begin to die one by one through a series of bizarre accidents, and Alex attempts to find a way to &quot;cheat&quot; Death's plan before it is too late. Six months later, Alex, Clear, and Carter travel to Paris to celebrate their survival, believing they have finally cheated Death; however, after Carter is crushed by a giant neon sign, they realize that Death's plan is still in action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|people=Wong, James (Director)|title=[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]|medium=[[DVD]]|location=United States|publisher=[[New Line Cinema]]|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Final Destination 2'', picking up one year after the first film, features college student Kimberly Corman ([[A. J. Cook (actress)|A. J. Cook]]) heading to [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]] for spring break with her friends Shaina, Dano, and Frankie ([[Sarah Carter]], Alex Rae, and [[Shaun Sipos]]). En route, Kimberly has a premonition of a huge car [[multiple-vehicle collision|pileup]] on Route 23, killing everyone involved. She stalls her SUV on the entrance ramp, preventing several people from entering the highway, including state trooper Thomas Burke ([[Michael Landes]]), Eugene Dix ([[Terrence C. Carson|T.C. Carson]]), Rory Peters ([[Jonathan Cherry (actor)|Jonathan Cherry]]), Kat Jennings ([[Keegan Connor Tracy]]), Nora and Tim Carpenter ([[Lynda Boyd]] and James Kirk), Evan Lewis ([[David Paetkau]]), and pregnant Isabella Hudson ([[Justina Machado]]). While Officer Burke questions Kimberly, the pileup occurs as she predicted. In the days following the accident, the survivors begin to die one by one in a series of bizarre accidents. After learning about the explosion of Flight 180, Kimberly teams up with Clear Rivers, the only survivor of Flight 180, to try to save a new group of people from Death. This time the survivors are told that only &quot;new life&quot; can defeat Death, and they must stay alive long enough for Isabella to have her baby. It is later revealed that Isabella was never meant to die in the pileup, and Kimberly drowns herself in a lake so that she can be resuscitated by emergency staff, thus granting her &quot;new life&quot;; saving her and Officer Burke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|people=Ellis, David R.

As Wendy and her friends board the Devil's Flight roller coaster, Wendy has a premonition that the ride will crash, killing everyone on board.

When the survivors start to die one by one in a series of strange accidents, Wendy and Kevin set out to save those who remain after they learn of the events of the first two films. They also figure out that the photographs they took at the park have hints of their deaths. Most of their attempts are futile, with the exception of Julie and themselves, leading them to believe they have cheated Death.

In &lt;!-- The film's title is &quot;The Final Destination&quot;, not &quot;Final Destination 4&quot; --&gt;''The Final Destination'', set nine years after the explosion of Flight 180, eight years after the pileup on Route 23, and four years after the Devil's Flight disaster, college student Nick O'Bannon ([[Bobby Campo]]) visits the McKinley Speedway for a study break with his friends Lori Milligan, Janet Cunningham, and Hunt Wynorski. While watching the race, Nick has a premonition that a race car crash will send debris into the stands, causing the stadium to collapse on the guests. When Nick panics a fight breaks out and several people leave before the accident occurs, including, his friends Lori ([[Shantel VanSanten]]), Janet ([[Haley Webb]]), and Hunt ([[Nick Zano]]), security guard George Lanter ([[Mykelti Williamson]]), and spectators Jonathan Groves (Jackson Walker), Andy Kewzer ([[Andrew Fiscella]]), Samantha Lane ([[Krista Allen]]), Carter Daniels ([[Justin Welborn]]), and Nadia Monroy ([[Stephanie Honoré]]). Once again, the survivors are killed in a series of strange accidents except for Janet, who is rescued just moments before her death. This leads the remaining survivors to believe that they have cheated Death, until Nick has another premonition of a disastrous explosion at a shopping mall, which he manages to prevent, saving himself, Lori, and Janet. Two weeks later, Nick realizes the mall disaster vision was only meant to lead them to where Death needed them to be and all three are killed by a runaway semi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|people=Ellis, David R.

{{main|Final Destination 5}}
In ''Final Destination 5'', Sam Lawton ([[Nicholas D'Agosto]]) is on his way to a corporate retreat with his colleagues. While they cross the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone on it. Sam manages to persuade several of his co-workers to get off the bridge before the accident occurs, including Molly Harper ([[Emma Bell]]), Nathan Sears ([[Arlen Escarpeta]]), Peter Friedkin ([[Miles Fisher]]), Dennis Lapman ([[David Koechner]]), [[Olivia Castle]] ([[Jacqueline MacInnes Wood]]), Isaac Palmer ([[P. J. Byrne]]), and Candice Hooper (Ellen Wroe). After Candice and Isaac die in bizarre accidents, Sam is warned that Death is still after the survivors and told that if he wants to live he must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge, and claim their remaining lifespan. Olivia and Dennis are killed before they have a chance to save themselves, but Nathan claims the lifespan of a co-worker when he accidentally causes his death in a warehouse accident. Peter attempts to kill Molly, jealous that she survived instead of Candice. He eventually gains the lifespan of an investigating agent, but is killed by Sam before he can kill Molly. Sam and Molly later board a plane to Paris, which is revealed to be Flight 180 from the first film. When the fuselage is torn apart by the exploding engine fragments, Molly is sucked out of the plane while Sam is killed in the subsequent explosion. The landing gear is sent flying towards New York City and crashes into a cocktail bar, killing Nathan, since the co-worker whose life he claimed had a terminal illness and was due to die &quot;any day now&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|people=Quale, Steven (Director)|title=[[Final Destination 5]]|medium=[[DVD]]|location=United States|publisher=[[Warner Bros.]]|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2011, Tony Todd said in an interview with [[Dread Central]] that if ''Final Destination 5'' was a success at the box office, then two sequels would be filmed [[back to back film production|back-to-back]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Tony Todd Talks Final Destination 5!

Never say never. I mean, it'll be up to the fans. We'll see how this one performs internationally, and if it makes as much money as the fourth one, I'm sure Warner Brothers will want to make another one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/news/ni14465558/|title=Steven Quale on Final Destination 6|date=23 August 2011|website=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2019, it was announced that a reboot is in development, from [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] and [[New Line Cinema]]. [[Patrick Melton]] and [[Marcus Dunstan]] will write the script, with the plot described as a &quot;re-imagining&quot; of the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/final-destination-reboot-works-saw-writers-1175489?|title='Final Destination' Reboot in the Works With 'Saw' Franchise Writers (Exclusive)|website=The Hollywood Reporter|last=Kit|first=Borys|date=January 11, 2019|accessdate=January 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2019, Devon Sawa expressed interest in returning to the franchise in the reboot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://movieweb.com/final-destination-reboot-devon-sawa-returning/|title=Original ‘Final Destination’ Star Devon Sawa Is Down to Return in a Reboot [Exclusive]|date=2019-08-21|website=Movieweb|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2020, it was announced that the film, set in the same canon as the first five films, would focus on first responders, with series producer Craig Perry stating, &quot;We're toying with having it take place in the world of first responders: EMTs, firemen, and police. These people deal with death on the front lines every day and make choices that can cause people to live or die. We rely on their good judgment, expertise, and calm demeanor. So why not put those people in the nightmare situation where every choice can bring about life and death – but now for themselves? We're thinking that world might be an interesting way into a ''Final Destination'' movie, and one which can also generate unique set pieces in a very credible way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2020/03/new-final-destination-film-plans-to-dive-into-the-world-of-first-responders/|title=New Final Destination film plans to dive into the world of first responders|date=2020-03-15|website=Flickering Myth|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical and public response===
The franchise has been praised for its innovative premise of the invisible abstract concept of Death killing people instead of a usual [[slasher killer]], and the creativity of the films' death sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Morrow |first= Brendan |title= Is 'Final Destination' the Best Horror Franchise in History? |url= http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3386435/final-destination-best-horror-franchise-history/ |website= [[Bloody Disgusting]] |access-date= 9 February 2017 |date= 2016-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novels===
Throughout 2005, publishing company [[Black Flame (publisher)|Black Flame]] released a series of ''Final Destination'' books which faithfully follow the premise of the films, with each involving a group of people who find themselves targeted by Death after surviving a catastrophe of some sort due to a character experiencing a precognitive vision. Their first five novels all featured original stories, with the first novel, entitled ''Dead Reckoning'', has [[punk rock]]er Jessica Golden saving herself and several others from the collapse of Club Kitty in [[Los Angeles]], earning Death's ire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rhodes | first = Natasha | title = Final Destination: Dead Reckoning | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2005-03-15 | isbn = 1844161706}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Destination Zero'', also set in LA, has magazine employee Patricia Fuller and few others survive a train bombing and afterward, while being stalked by Death, Patti learns this is not the first time her family has been hunted by the entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McIntee | first = David | title = Final Destination: Destination Zero | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2005-03-15 | isbn = 1844161714}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''End of the Line'' has a group of [[New York City]] [[New York City Subway|subway]] crash survivors, led by twins Danny and Louise King, trying to escape Death, who uses an unknowing agent to hasten its acquisition of the survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Levene | first = Rebecca | title = Final Destination: End of the Line | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2005-06-07 | isbn = 1844161765}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Dead Man's Hand'' a group meant to die in the crash of a [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] glass elevator are stalked by both Death and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], the latter believing the group's savior Allie Goodwin-Gaines was responsible for the elevator crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Roman | first = Steven | title = Final Destination: Dead Man's Hand | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2005-09-13 | isbn = 1844161773}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Looks Could Kill'' has beautiful New York model Stephanie &quot;Sherry&quot; Pulaski stopping her friends from boarding a [[yacht]] when she has a vision of it exploding, but is left horribly disfigured and comatose by flying debris moments afterward when her vision comes true; eventually awakening the embittered Stephanie makes a deal with Death, aiding it in claiming her friends in exchange for having her good looks restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Collins | first = Nancy | title = Final Destination: Looks Could Kill | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2005-11-29 | isbn = 1844163164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the run of the original series of books Black Flame released novelizations of the first three films in January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rhodes | first = Natasha | title = Final Destination | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2006-01-03 | isbn = 1844163172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Collins | first = Nancy | title = Final Destination 2 | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2006-01-31 | isbn = 1844163180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Faust | first = Christa |authorlink=Christa Faust | title = Final Destination 3 | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2006-01-03 | isbn = 1844163199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black Flame's last ''Final Destination'' novel was ''Death of the Senses'' released in mid-2006. Taking place in New York the book has a homeless man named Jack Curtis saving policewoman Amy Tom from a maniac after having a vision of Amy's death; Amy's attacker is later revealed to be a serial killer who was meant to murder six other people (representing the first [[sense|five senses]] and [[Extrasensory perception|a sixth]]) who Death begins targeting as Jack and Amy rush to find and warn the intended victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McDermott | first = Andy | title = Final Destination: Death of the Senses | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2006-08-01 | isbn = 1844163857}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was, due to a printing error, only available for a short period of time before being recalled, leaving only a few copies in circulation. A tenth novel, titled ''Wipeout'' and written by Alex Johnson, was planned, but cancelled; the book would have featured a pair of surfers and several others, after surviving a plane crash in Hawaii, being hunted by Death and the survivor of another disaster, an unstable soldier who had nearly died in an ambush in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnson | first = Alex | title = Final Destination: Wipeout | publisher = Black Flame | date = December 2010| isbn = 1844164098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comic books===
The first ''Final Destination'' comic book, titled ''Sacrifice'', was published by [[Zenescope Entertainment]] and came packaged with a limited edition DVD of ''Final Destination 3'', sold exclusively at [[Circuit City Corporation|Circuit City]] stores. The premise of the story involves the survivor of a terrible accident and his friend Jim, who continually experiences images of other people's deaths, isolating himself from the rest of the world to escape the visions that torment him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zenescope &amp; Circuit City Offer Exclusive &quot;Final Destination&quot; Comic |url=http://www.cbr.com/zenescope-circuit-city-offer-exclusive-final-destination-comic/ |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |access-date=14 July 2017 |archive-date=14 July 2017 |date=13 June 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714210224/http://www.cbr.com/zenescope-circuit-city-offer-exclusive-final-destination-comic/ |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zenescope later released a five issue miniseries, titled ''Final Destination: Spring Break'', which involves a group led by Carly Hagan being stalked by Death after surviving a hotel fire and becoming stranded in [[Cancún|Cancún, Mexico]].
