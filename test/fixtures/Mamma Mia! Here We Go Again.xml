'''''Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again''''' is a 2018 [[jukebox musical]] [[romantic comedy]] film written and directed by [[Ol Parker]], from a story by Parker, [[Catherine Johnson (playwright)|Catherine Johnson]], and [[Richard Curtis]]. It is a follow-up to the 2008 film ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia!]]'', which in turn is based on the [[West End theatre|West End]]/[[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Mamma Mia!|musical of the same name]] using the music of [[ABBA]]. The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Dominic Cooper]], [[Amanda Seyfried]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Colin Firth]], [[Stellan Skarsgård]], [[Jeremy Irvine]], [[Josh Dylan]], [[Hugh Skinner]], [[Lily James]], [[Jessica Keenan Wynn]], [[Alexa Davies]], [[Christine Baranski]], [[Julie Walters]], [[Andy García]], [[Meryl Streep]], and [[Cher]]. Both a [[prequel]] and a [[sequel]], the plot is set after the events of the previous film, and also features flashbacks to 1979, telling the story of Donna Sheridan's arrival on the island of Kalokairi and her first meetings with her daughter Sophie's three possible fathers.

Due to the financial success of the first film, [[Universal Pictures]] had long been interested in a sequel. The film was officially announced in May 2017, with Parker hired to write and direct. In June 2017, many of the original cast confirmed their involvement, with James being cast in the role of Young Donna that July. Filming took place from August to December 2017 in [[Croatia]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Stockholm]], [[Oxford]], [[Hampton, London|Hampton]] and at [[Shepperton Studios]]. A [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[United States|American]] joint venture, the film was co-produced by [[Playtone]], Littlestar Productions and [[Legendary Entertainment]].

''Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again'' was premiered at the [[Hammersmith Apollo]] in [[London]] on July 16, 2018, and was released in the United Kingdom and the United States on July 20, 2018, ten years to the week after its predecessor's release, in both standard and [[IMAX]] formats.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMAX&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|title=Imax Kicks Off Biggest Global Campaign Ever In 77 Countries: &quot;Films To The Fullest&quot;|url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/imax-new-global-brand-campaign-films-to-the-fullest-1202433962/|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=July 26, 2018 |accessdate=August 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a box office success, grossing $395 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the performances and musical numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ellis|last=Clopton|title=‘Mamma Mia!

==Plot==
Sophie Sheridan is preparing for the grand reopening of her mother Donna's hotel, following Donna's death a year earlier (&quot;Thank You for the Music&quot;) she is upset because two of her fathers, Harry and Bill, are unable to make it to the reopening and she is having trouble in her relationship with Sky, who is in [[New York City|New York]] learning about hotel management, over her memorializing her mother's life (&quot;One of Us&quot;).

In 1979, a young Donna graduates from [[New College, Oxford]] with Rosie and Tanya (&quot;When I Kissed the Teacher&quot;) and prepares to travel the world. In [[Paris]], she meets and parties with Harry. They spend the night together (&quot;Waterloo&quot;), but Donna leaves soon after. She misses her boat to Kalokairi, but is offered a ride by Bill, and along the way, they are able to help a stranded fisherman, Alexio, back to shore in time to stop the love of his life from marrying another. Unbeknownst to Donna, Harry has followed her to [[Greece]]; however, he arrived too late, and sadly watches the boat sailing off in the distance (&quot;Why Did it Have to Be Me?&quot;).

In the present, Tanya and Rosie arrive to support Sophie with the reopening and it's revealed that Rosie and Bill have split up (&quot;Angel Eyes&quot;) Sophie then visits Sam, who, like Sophie, is still grieving over the death of Donna. Back in the past, Donna arrives on the island (&quot;I Have a Dream&quot;) and while exploring the farmhouse, a sudden storm causes her to discover a spooked horse in the basement. She seeks for help and finds a young Sam riding his motorcycle and he helps her to save the horse. Back in the present, a storm has caused serious disruption to Sophie's plans for the grand reopening and prevented media coverage of the event.

Back in the past, Donna and Sam are enjoying a whirlwind romance (&quot;Andante, Andante&quot;, &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;) until Donna discovers a picture of Sam's fiancée Lorraine in his drawer. Devastated, Donna demands  Sam to leave the island and refuses to see him again (&quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot;) in the present, Sam tells Sophie about her value to her mother. Meanwhile, Harry leaves his business deal in [[Tokyo]] to support Sophie, and in [[Stockholm]], Bill gets the same idea. Bill and Harry meet at the docks but are told there are no boats. However, Alexio gives Bill, Harry, the newly arrived Sky and hundreds of others boat passage.

In the past, a depressed Donna is visited by Tanya and Rosie. In a local bar, Donna regains her spirit with Tanya and Rosie's help (&quot;Mamma Mia&quot;) she meets Bill again and they go out on his boat; while they are gone, Sam returns, having recently ended his engagement for Donna, but is saddened to hear that she is with another man and leaves the island once again. Donna discovers she is pregnant but has no idea which one of her three recent lovers is the father. Sofia, the mother of the owner of the bar where Donna and the Dynamos performed, overhears Donna's wish to stay on the island, and Donna happily accepts her offer to let her live at her farmhouse, where she eventually gives birth to Sophie.

Back in the present, the guests have arrived at the party and Sophie is reunited with her other two fathers and Sky (&quot;Dancing Queen&quot;). Sophie reveals to Sky that she is pregnant and has never felt closer to her mother, having now understood what her mother went through. Bill and Rosie reunite over their grief for Donna. Sophie's estranged grandmother and Donna's mother, Ruby, arrives despite Sophie having decided not to invite her. She reveals that Sky tracked her down in New York and she wants to build a real relationship with Sophie. Sophie then performs a song with Tanya and Rosie in honor of her mother (&quot;I've Been Waiting For You&quot;) with her grandmother tearfully telling her afterwards how proud she is of her. Ruby later reunites with Fernando, the hotel’s manager and her former lover back in 1959 (&quot;Fernando&quot;).

Nine months later, Sophie has given birth to a baby boy. Everyone has gathered for his christening where Tanya flirts with Fernando's brother. The ceremony takes place with Donna's spirit watching over her daughter with pride as the two of them have one final moment before Donna's spirit passes on (&quot;My Love, My Life&quot;) at the end, all the characters, including Donna and the younger cast, sing &quot;Super Trouper&quot; at a huge party at Hotel Bella Donna.

On review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on 267 reviews, and a weighted average of 6.28/10. The website's critical consensus reads, &quot;''Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again'' doubles down on just about everything fans loved about the original—and my my, how can fans resist it?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mamma_mia_here_we_go_again|title=Mamma Mia!

[[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' termed the sequel as &quot;weirdly irresistible&quot; and gave it three out of five stars. He described his reaction to the first film as &quot;a combination of hives and bubonic plague,&quot; but concedes that this time, the relentlessness and greater self-aware comedy made him smile. He concludes: &quot;More enjoyable than I thought. But please. Enough now.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/17/mamma-mia-here-we-go-again-review-feta-fever-dream-sequel-is-weirdly-irresistible |title=Mamma Mia!

[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' awarded the film two and a half stars out of five, noting the absence of Streep for the majority of the film hindered his enjoyment, and saying, &quot;her absence is deeply felt since the three-time Oscar winner sang and danced her heart out as Donna Sheridan&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Travers |first1=Peter |title=‘Mamma Mia!

He considered the younger counterparts to the main characters &quot;energetic&quot; and &quot;likeable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CST&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Roeper |first1=Richard |title='Mamma Mia!
