==Plot==
''The Owner'' follows a lost [[backpack]] on a journey around the world, meeting several fascinating characters along the way. As the story progresses, we learn details about the mysterious man to whom the bag belongs—a man named &quot;[[MacGuffin]].&quot; The film brings together a variety of cultures, languages and [[film styles]] into a singular narrative [[narrative|plot]].

The feature consists of 25 independently produced short segments (2 to 5 minutes) that are connected by the backpack's journey. Each segment picks up the narrative where the previous segment leaves off and in some cases are inter-cut.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;1&lt;/ref&gt;
