'''''Enter the Dragon''''' is a 1973 [[martial arts film]] produced by and starring [[Bruce Lee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;boxoffice&quot;/&gt; The film, which co-stars [[John Saxon]] and [[Jim Kelly (martial artist)|Jim Kelly]], was directed by [[Robert Clouse]]. It would be Bruce Lee's final completed film appearance before his death on 20 July 1973 at age 32. A joint American and Hong Kong production, it premiered in Los Angeles on 19 August 1973, one month after Lee's death and went on to gross {{US$|90 million}} worldwide,&lt;ref name=&quot;rottentomatoes&quot;/&gt; equivalent to {{US$|{{Inflation|US|90|1973}} million}} adjusted for inflation.

==Plot==
Lee, a highly proficient Shaolin martial artist and instructor from Hong Kong, is approached by Braithwaite, a British intelligence agent investigating the suspected crime lord Han. Lee is persuaded to attend a high-profile martial arts competition on Han's private island to gather evidence that will prove Han's involvement in drug trafficking and prostitution. Shortly before his departure, Lee also learns that the man responsible for his sister's death, O'Hara, is working as Han's bodyguard on the island. Also fighting in the competition are Roper, an indebted gambling addict, and fellow Vietnam war veteran Williams.

At the end of the first day, Han gives strict orders to the competitors not to leave their rooms. Lee makes contact with undercover operative Mei Ling and sneaks into Han's compound, looking for evidence. He is discovered by several guards but manages to escape. The next morning, Han orders his giant guard Bolo to kill the guards in public for failing their duties. After the execution, Lee faces O'Hara in the competition and ends up killing him. With the day's competition over, Han confronts Williams, who had also left his room the previous night to exercise. Han believes Williams to be the intruder and beats him to death when he refuses to cooperate. Han then reveals his drug operation to Roper, hoping that he will join his organisation. He also implicitly threatens to imprison Roper, along with all the other martial artists who joined Han's tournaments in the past, if Roper refuses. Despite being initially intrigued, Roper refuses after learning of Williams's fate.

Lee sneaks out again that night and manages to send a message to Braithwaite, but he is captured after a prolonged battle with the guards. The next morning, Han arranges for Roper to fight Lee, but Roper refuses. As a punishment, Roper has to fight Bolo instead, whom he manages to overpower and beat after a gruelling encounter. Enraged by the unexpected failure, Han commands his remaining men to kill Lee and Roper. Facing insurmountable odds, they are soon aided by the island's prisoners, who had been freed by Mei Ling. Han escapes and is pursued by Lee, who finally corners him in his museum. After a brutal fight, Han runs away into a hidden mirror room. The mirrors give Han an advantage, but Lee breaks all the room's mirrors to reveal Han's location, and eventually kills him. Lee returns outside to the main battle, which is now over. A bruised and bloodied Roper sits victorious while the military finally arrive to take control of the island.

==Production==
Due to the success with his earlier films, [[Warner Bros]] began helping Bruce Lee with the film in 1972. They brought in producers [[Fred Weintraub]] and [[Paul Heller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Distinguished Asian Americans: A Biographical Dictionary|first=Hyung-chan|last=Kim|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1999|isbn=9780313289026|page=[https://archive.org/details/distinguishedasi00kimh/page/179 179]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/distinguishedasi00kimh/page/179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
The screenplay title was originally named ''Blood and Steel''. The story features Asian, White and Black heroic protagonists because the producers wanted a film that would appeal to the widest possible international audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Brian |last=Locke|title=Racial Stigma on the Hollywood Screen from World War II to the Present: The Orientalist Buddy Film|publisher=Springer|year= 2009|isbn= 9780230101678 |page=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CU9rAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q=peter%20archer%20enter%20the%20dragon 71]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The scene in which Lee states that his style is &quot;Fighting Without Fighting&quot; is based upon a famous anecdote involving the 16th century [[samurai]] [[Tsukahara Bokuden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;martialDirect&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martialdirect.com/articles/bruceleept1.htm|title=Bruce Lee Said What?

===Casting===
[[John Saxon]] is a black belt in [[Judo]] and [[Shotokan Karate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TNcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=The+Growth+of+Judo+and+Karate+Declining+in+the+US|title=Black Belt|first=Active Interest Media|last=Inc|date=1 August 1973|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|accessdate=3 January 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; who studied under [[Grandmaster (martial arts)|grandmaster]] [[Hidetaka Nishiyama]] for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 1973|title=New Bruce Lee Film on its way to American movie theatres|journal=[[Black Belt magazine]]|volume=11|pages=11–12|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In negotiations, his agent told the film's producers that if they wanted him they would have to change the story so that the character of Williams would be killed, not Roper. They agreed and the script was changed.&lt;ref name=&quot;talk&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Reflections on Blaxploitation: Actors and Directors Speak|last=Walker|first=David , Andrew J.

[[Rockne Tarkington]] was originally cast in the role of Williams. However, he unexpectedly dropped out days before the production was about to begin in Hong Kong. Producer Fred Weintraub knew that karate world champion, [[Jim Kelly (martial artist)|Jim Kelly]] had a training dojo in [[Crenshaw, Los Angeles]] so he hastily arranged a meeting. Weintraub was immediately impressed, and Kelly was cast in the film.&lt;ref name=horn&gt;{{citation|last=Horn|first=John|title=Jim Kelly, 'Enter the Dragon' star, dies at 67|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1 July 2013|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-jim-kelly-enter-the-dragon-star-dies-20130701,0,852055.story|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of Kelly's appearance launched his career as a star: after ''Enter the Dragon'', he signed a three-film deal with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Blackbelt&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-c8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q=black%20belt%20may%201992%20p%2018|title=Black Belt Magazine|last=Clary|first=David|date=May 1992|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|isbn=|location=|pages=18–21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to make several martial arts-themed [[blaxploitation]] films in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''Reflections on Blaxploitation: Actors and Directors Speak'', 2009. pps.[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LofIsZJPfEcC&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q=jim%20kelly%20 129–130]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jackie Chan]] appears as a guard during the underground lair battle scene and gets his neck snapped by Lee. He also performed several stunts for the film, including the scene where Lee's character quickly climbs a rooftop at night. However, [[Yuen Wah]] was Lee's main stunt double for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ringtalk.com/those-amazing-bruce-lee-film-stunts|title=THOSE AMAZING BRUCE LEE FILM STUNTS|last=Boutwell|first=Malcolm|date=7 July 2015|website=ringtalk.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151130210705/http://ringtalk.com/those-amazing-bruce-lee-film-stunts|archive-date=30 November 2015|url-status=dead|access-date=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sammo Hung]] appears in a brief fight scene against Lee at the start of the film.

An urban legend surrounding the making of ''Enter The Dragon'' claims that actor [[Robert Wall|Bob Wall]] did not like Bruce Lee and that their fight scenes were not choreographed. However, Wall has denied this stating he and Lee were actually good friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityonfire.com/feature-bob-wall-interview/|title=Bob Wall Interview|last=Bona|first=JJ|date=10 January 2011|website=Cityonfire|publisher=cityonfire.com|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
The film was shot on location in Hong Kong. All scenes were filmed without sound: dialogue and sound effects were added or dubbed in during [[post-production]]. Bruce Lee, after he had been goaded or challenged, fought several real fights with the film's [[Extra (acting)|extras]] and some set intruders during filming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit|first=Bruce|last= Thomas|publisher=Pan Macmillan|year= 2008|isbn=9780283070662|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scenes of Han's Island were filmed at a residence known as Palm Villa near the coastal town of [[Stanley, Hong Kong|Stanley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmapia.com/where-is-it-shot/films/enter-the-dragon|title=Enter the Dragon Movie Shooting Locations  |publisher=filmapia.com|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soundtrack===
{{further|Enter the Dragon (soundtrack)}}
Argentinian musician [[Lalo Schifrin]] composed the film's musical score. While Schifrin was widely known at the time for his jazz scores, he also incorporated funk and traditional film score elements into the film's soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Guarisco|first=Donald|title=Lalo Schifrin: Enter the Dragon [Music from the Motion Picture] – Review|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/lalo-schifrin-enter-the-dragon-music-from-the-motion-picture-mw0000458280|website=All Music Guide|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He composed the score by sampling sounds from China, [[Korea]], and Japan. The soundtrack has sold over 500,000 copies, earning a [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]].&lt;ref name=&quot;press.uillinois.edu&quot;/&gt;

==Release==
===Box office===
''Enter the Dragon'' was heavily advertised in the United States before its release. The budget for advertising was over $1,000,000. It was unlike any promotional campaign that had been seen before, and was extremely comprehensive. To advertise the film, the studio offered free [[Karate]] classes, produced thousands of illustrated flip books, comic books, posters, photographs, and organised dozens of news releases, interviews, and public appearances for the stars. ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and ''[[Newsweek]]'' all wrote stories on the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peirano|first=Pierre-François|date=22 April 2013|title=The Multiple Facets of Enter the Dragon (Robert Clouse, 1973)|url=http://inmedia.revues.org/613|journal=InMedia.

The filmed earned a profit of {{US$|25 million}} in the United States,&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; against a tight budget of $850,000.&lt;ref&gt;''Variety'' says the film earned $4.25&amp;nbsp;million in North American rentals in 1973.

The review stated &quot;The picture is expertly made and well-meshed; it moves like lightning and brims with color. It is also the most savagely murderous and numbing hand-hacker (not a gun in it) you will ever see anywhere.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9500E3D71631E63BBC4052DFBE668388669EDE|title=Movie Review - - 'Enter Dragon,' Hollywood Style:The Cast |last=Thompson|first=Howard|date=18 August 1973|website=The New York Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131232805/https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9500E3D71631E63BBC4052DFBE668388669EDE|archive-date=31 January 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship and home video==
''Enter the Dragon'' has remained one of the most popular martial arts films since its premiere and has been released numerous times worldwide on every home video format. For almost three decades, many theatrical and home video versions were censored for violence, especially in the West. Since 2001, the film has been released uncut in the UK and most other territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbfc.co.uk/case-studies/enter-dragon|title=BBFC Case Studies: Enter the Dragon (1973)|website=bbfc.co.uk|publisher=British Board of Film Classification}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://melonfarmers.co.uk/bbfc_cuts_enter_the_dragon.htm|title=Enter the Dragon: Bruce Lee vs the BBFC|website=Melonfarmers.co.uk|publisher=MelonFarmers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''Enter the Dragon'' has been cited as one of the most influential [[action films]] of all time. ''WhatCulture'' listed it among the top ten most influential action movies ever made, noting that it was &quot;directly responsible for huge numbers of people taking up [[martial arts]], helped popularize [[Eastern cinema]] in the United States and spawned the '[[kung-fu]] craze' of the '70s&quot; as well as establishing Bruce Lee as the most famous martial artist and launching the careers of [[Jackie Chan]], [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Jim Kelly (martial artist)|Jim Kelly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=10 Most Influential Action Movies Ever Made |url=https://whatculture.com/film/10-most-influential-action-movies-ever-made?page=2 |website=WhatCulture |accessdate=23 March 2020 |date=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sascha Matuszak of ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' called it the most influential [[kung fu film]] and said it &quot;is referenced in all manner of media, the plot line and characters continue to influence storytellers today, and the impact was particularly felt in the revolutionizing way the film portrayed [[African-Americans]], [[Asians]] and traditional martial arts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Matuszak |first1=Sascha |title=Bruce Lee's Last Words: Enter the Dragon and the Martial Arts Explosion |url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/bruce-lees-last-words-enter-the-dragon-and-the-martial-arts-explosion |website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |accessdate=23 March 2020 |date=July 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joel Stice of ''[[Uproxx]]'' called it &quot;arguably the most influential Kung Fu movie of all time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stice |first1=Joel |title=Bruce Lee Was Bitten By A Cobra And 5 Other Surprising 'Enter The Dragon' Facts |url=https://uproxx.com/movies/enter-the-draon-trivia/ |website=[[Uproxx]] |accessdate=23 March 2020 |date=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuan-Hsing Chen and Beng Huat Chua cited its [[fight scenes]] as influential as well as its &quot;hybrid form and its mode of address&quot; which pitches &quot;an elemental story of good against evil in such a spectacle-saturated way&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chen |first1=Kuan-Hsing |last2=Chua |first2=Beng Huat |title=The Inter-Asia Cultural Studies Reader |date=2015 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-1-134-08396-1 |page=489 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q4d4CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT489}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The film has been [[Parody|parodied]] and referenced in places such as the 1976 film ''[[The Pink Panther Strikes Again]]'', the satirical publication ''[[The Onion]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/content/node/30496|title=Rumsfeld Hosts No-Holds-Barred Martial Arts Tournament at Remote Island Fortress|date=17 March 2004|access-date=15 August 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815131719/http://www.theonion.com/content/node/30496|archive-date=15 August 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Japanese game-show ''[[Takeshi's Castle]]'', and the 1977 [[John Landis]] comedy anthology film ''[[Kentucky Fried Movie]]'' (in its lengthy &quot;A Fistful of Yen&quot; sequence, basically a comedic, note for note remake of ''Dragon'') and also in the film ''[[Balls of Fury]]''. It was also parodied on television in ''[[That '70s Show]]'' during the episode &quot;[[Jackie Moves On]]&quot; with regular character [[Fez (That '70s Show)|Fez]] taking on the Bruce Lee role. Several clips from the film are comically used during the theatre scene in ''[[The Last Dragon]]''.

The little-known 1985 Nintendo arcade game ''[[Arm Wrestling (video game)|Arm Wrestling]]'' contains voice leftovers from the film, as well as their original counterparts.

The ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' [[manga]] and [[anime]] franchise was inspired by ''Enter the Dragon'', which ''Dragon Ball'' creator [[Akira Toriyama]] was a fan of.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guide&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=TV Anime Guide: Dragon Ball Z Son Goku Densetsu |date=2003 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |isbn=4088735463 |chapter=Akira Toriyama × Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru |chapter-url=https://www.kanzenshuu.com/translations/son-goku-densetsu-toriyama-x-nakatsuru/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dragon Ball Z Legend: The Quest Continues |date=2004 |publisher=DH Publishing Inc |isbn=9780972312493 |page=[https://archive.org/details/dragonballzlegen00iked/page/n6 7] |url=https://archive.org/details/dragonballzlegen00iked|url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt; The title ''Dragon Ball'' was also inspired by ''Enter the Dragon'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Guide&quot;/&gt; and the piercing eyes of [[Goku]]'s Super Saiyan transformation was based on Bruce Lee's paralysing glare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Comic Legends: Why Did Goku's Hair Turn Blonde? |url=https://www.cbr.com/goku-dragon-ball-blonde/ |accessdate=21 November 2019 |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Enter the Dragon'' was the foundation for [[fighting games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kapell |first1=Matthew Wilhelm |title=The Play Versus Story Divide in Game Studies: Critical Essays |date=2015 |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]] |isbn=978-1-4766-2309-2 |page=166 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6s_-CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA166}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Street Fighter]]'' video game franchise was inspired by ''Enter the Dragon'', with the gameplay centered around an international fighting tournament, and each character having a unique combination of ethnicity, nationality and fighting style. ''Street Fighter'' went on to set the template for all fighting games that followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thrasher |first1=Christopher David |title=Fight Sports and American Masculinity: Salvation in Violence from 1607 to the Present |date=2015 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-1-4766-1823-4 |page=208 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=77zwCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA208}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular 1980s martial arts [[beat 'em up]] video game ''[[Double Dragon]]'' features two enemies named Roper and Williams, a reference to the two characters Roper and Williams from ''Enter the Dragon''. The sequel includes opponents named Bolo and Oharra. The popular fighting game ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' borrows multiple plot elements from ''Enter the Dragon'', as does its [[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|movie adaptation]].

In August 2007, the now defunct [[Warner Independent Pictures]] announced that television producer [[Kurt Sutter]] would be remaking the film as a [[Film noir|noir-style]] thriller entitled ''Awaken the Dragon'' with Korean singer-actor [[Rain (entertainer)|Rain]] starring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117969988.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1|title=Warners to remake 'Enter the Dragon'|last=Fleming|first=Michael|date=9 August 2007|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=12 August 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418034915/http://variety.com/2007/film/markets-festivals/warners-to-remake-enter-the-dragon-2-1117969988/|archive-date=18 April 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/57745-will-rain-awaken-the-dragon|title=Will Rain Awaken the Dragon ?|publisher=[[ComingSoon.net]]|author=CS|date=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Exclusive-Rain-Confirms-He-s-Still-Considering-Enter-The-Dragon-Remake-15692.html|title=Exclusive: Rain Confirms He's Still Considering Enter The Dragon Remake|publisher=Cinema Blend|last=Rich|first=Kathy|date=13 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced in September 2014 that [[Spike Lee]] would work on the remake.

Lee's martial arts films were broadly lampooned in the recurring ''[[Almost Live!]]'' sketch ''Mind Your Manners with'' ''[[Billy Quan]]''.
