== Plot ==
Journalist Anand Ingalagi's book ''El-Dorado'', that detailed events at the [[Kolar Gold Fields]] between 1951 and present day, has been banned by the Government of India and all published copies burnt. However, a television news channel procures a copy and interviews him circling the events.

Ingalagi narrates that [[ore]] of gold was discovered by commissioned government officials in the southern part of India's [[Mysore State]] (in present-day [[Kolar district]], [[Karnataka]]) in 1951. Raja Krishnappa &quot;Rocky&quot; Bairya is also born on the day of the discovery in the [[Mysore (region)|Mysore region]], to a poor and widowed woman.Suryavardhan, one of the workers that accompanied the officials kills the officials. Discerning the increasing demand for gold by the [[Cold War]] belligerents, Suryavardhan deceitfully sets up a company, Narachi, in that land, bought for a lease of 99 years on the pretext of mining [[limestone]]. He has five associates, all of who operate away from KGF: Kamal, the son of a former associate Bharghav; Rajendra Desai, the father of Reena, Andrews, who oversees operations in the [[Konkan]] and [[Malabar Coast]]s; Guru Pandian, a powerful politician and president of the DYSS party; and brother Adheera. However, each of them has their eyes on the mines. Andrews' underboss Shetty is a gold smuggler in [[Bombay]], the city that also has another smuggler, Dubai-based Inayat Khalil's eyes set on.

Rocky arrives in Bombay as a ten-year-old on a quest for power and wealth as desired by his dying mother and begins to work for Shetty. He becomes Shetty's right-hand man later and oversees the arrival of [[gold bar]]s from Africa to the Bombay coast with an iron fist, and soon rises in strength and power rivalling that of Shetty's. This attracts Andrews who offers him Bombay in return for assassinating Garuda, the younger son of Suryavardhan, who was seen to inherit KGF after his paralysed father's passing. Rocky accepts the offer and heads to [[Bangalore]] where an event is staged for the purpose. Once there, he witnesses the sheer presence,authority and power that Garuda commands and has the attempt averted.

In 1978, at the KGF, a bedridden Suryavardhan announces Garuda as his successor overlooking Adheera, who he wants to serve as the latter's aide. Garuda's ruthless way of functioning aided by his commander Vanaram comes to fore. Rocky soon makes his way into KGF evading a unit of henchmen. Once there, he witnesses the brutality that the slaves are subjected to. Although apathetic at first, he is moved by a couple of incidents involving a cold-blooded killing of a mother and son at the hands of an overseer and the slaves' children hoping that he rises to liberate them. Beginning his attempt at it and to indicate to Desai and his men through informants, Kulkarni and Garuda's virtuous brother Virat, that he was alive, as planned, Rocky engages in a fight with a unit of twenty-one overseers killing each one of them in order to save a blind slave they were to kill. With the act, Rocky emerges as a hero in the slaves' eyes.

An alerted Vanaram now informs Garuda who heads toward the mines from his palatial residence. To avert thousands of slaves being killed due to his fury, Virat smothers father Suryavardhan to death and sidetracks Garuda, who rushes back home. At the mines, Rocky seizes the opportunity, conspires and unsuspectingly heads through a tunnel to the site where Garuda has decided to behead three slaves as [[Human sacrifice|offerings]] to a deity. Upon Garuda's return to the site and sacrifice of two slaves, a concealed Rocky emerges and beheads him. The ecstatic slaves accept him as their leader as they cheer him on. The narrator concludes that Rocky intentionally chose KGF as the site to assassinate Garuda, in order to earn the will of an &quot;army of people&quot;, the slaves, before he seized KGF to his control but still there are people who are waiting to acquire the throne and how Rocky will face them as one man army and why he was given a death warrant by Prime Minister Ramika Sen will be shown in [[K.G.F: Chapter 2|Chapter 2]].

Janani K. of ''[[India Today]]'' felt the film was &quot;dragged and over-stretched&quot; and gave it a three out of five-star rating. While she commended Yash's &quot;extraordinary performance&quot; and the &quot;brilliantly choreographed stunt sequences&quot;, she wrote that despite having &quot;universal theme, [the film] gets lost in translation, thanks to sloppy editing and atrocious dialogues.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=K. |first1=Janani |title=KGF Chapter 1 Movie Review: Sloppy writing spoils Yash's intriguing gangster drama |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/reviews/story/kgf-chapter-1-movie-review-sloppy-writing-spoils-yash-s-intriguing-gangster-drama-1414701-2018-12-21 |website=India Today |accessdate=22 December 2018 |language=en |date=21 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subha J.

Excepting what he described the film's climax as &quot;spectacular with the support of a brilliant cast&quot; and &quot;spot on&quot; sets and location, Muralidhara Khajane of ''[[The Hindu]]'' felt there was &quot;nothing in the film that we have not seen before&quot;.
