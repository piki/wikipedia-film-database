==Plot==

Balaraman Pillai ([[Sankaradi]]) is a well-to-do villager living in [[Kuttanadu]]. He and his wife Sarasamma ([[Sukumari]]) are looking for a suitable alliance for their younger daughter Mini ([[Lissy Priyadarsan]]). Balaraman Pillai receives a letter from his son-in-law, Ayyappan Kutty, living in [[Chennai|Madras]] informing that an engineer named Kumar from his company is arriving in the village to oversee a construction project. Ayyappan Kutty suggests Kumar as a suitable groom for Mini.

Kumar ([[Suresh Gopi]]) arrives in the village and is received by Balaraman Pillai, who arranges accommodation for Kumar. Balaraman Pillai invites Kumar home for dinner and introduces Mini. Kumar and Mini develop a liking for each other. With encouragement from her parents, Mini and Kumar fall in love with each other.

A comic sub plot runs in parallel where the village postman Kamalasanan ([[Sreenivasan]]) is in love with Chandramathi ([[Soorya]]), while his friend Sahadevan ([[Jagathy Sreekumar]]) is afraid of his hard talking wife Parukkutty Amma ([[Lalithasree]]).

Balaraman Pillai receives another letter from Ayyappan Kutty stating that Kumar is not the engineer, but an overseer of the same company. This changes Balaraman Pillai and Sarasamma's attitude towards Kumar. They forbid Mini from meeting Kumar. The plot thickens as the engineer Krishnakumar ([[Mukesh (actor)|Mukesh]]) arrives in the village.
