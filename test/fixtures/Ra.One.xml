'''''Ra.One''''' is a 2011 [[Cinema of India|Indian]] [[Hindi]]-language [[superhero film]] directed by [[Anubhav Sinha]] and starring [[Shah Rukh Khan]], Armaan Verma, [[Kareena Kapoor]], [[Arjun Rampal]], [[Shahana Goswami]] and [[Tom Wu]] in pivotal roles. The script, written by [[Anubhav Sinha]] and [[Kanika Dhillon]], originated as an idea that [[Anubhav Sinha]] got when he saw a television commercial and which he subsequently expanded. The film follows Shekhar Subramanium (Shah Rukh Khan), a game designer who creates a [[Motion controller|motion sensor]]-based game in which the antagonist (Ra.One) is more powerful than the protagonist (G.One). The former escapes from the game's virtual world and enters the real world; his aim is to kill Lucifer, the game ID of Shekhar's son and the only player to have challenged Ra.One's power. Relentlessly pursued, the family is forced to bring out G.One from the virtual world to defeat Ra.One and protect them.

[[Principal photography]] began in March 2010 and took place in [[India]] and the [[United Kingdom]] and was overseen by an international crew. The [[post-production]] involved [[stereoscopy|3-D conversion]] and the application of [[visual effects]], the latter being recognised as a technological breakthrough among [[Cinema of India|Indian films]]. With a budget of {{INRConvert|150|c|year=2011}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/despite-rs-170cr-income-ra-one-not-a-hit/story-yw7lvEwuItuSwHIIBGpFyI.html | title=Despite Rs 170cr income, RA.One not a hit?| date=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; inclusive of publicity costs, ''Ra.One'' was the [[List of most expensive Indian films|most expensive Indian film]] at the time of release surpassing the {{INRConvert|132|c|year=2010}} budget of ''[[Enthiran]]''. The producers spent {{INRConvert|130|c|year=2011}} out of a {{INRConvert|52|c|year=2011}} marketing budget, which involved a nine-month publicity campaign, brand tie-ups, merchandise, video games and [[viral marketing]].

The film faced controversies involving plagiarism, content leaks and copyright challenges. Consequently, ''Ra.One'' was theatrically released on 26 October 2011, the beginning of the five-day [[Diwali]] weekend, in 2D, 3D and dubbed versions in Tamil and Telugu languages, with three international premieres being held between 24 &amp; 26 October 2011. The film witnessed the largest international theatrical release for an Indian film as of 2011, and was preceded by high audience and commercial expectations.

Upon release, ''Ra.One'' received mixed to positive reviews, with critics praising the visual effects, action sequences, music, and the performances of Khan and Rampal, but criticising the script, direction, and screenplay. Commercially, the film became [[List of Bollywood films of 2011|the third highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2011]] domestically, the second highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2011 worldwide, and broke a number of opening box office records. As the film earned more than ₹207 crores, it was considered a &quot;Hit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficeindia.com/movie.php?movieid=28|title=Ra.One - Movie|website=[[Box Office India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film subsequently won a number of awards for its technical aspects, notably one [[59th National Film Awards|National Film Award]], one [[57th Filmfare Awards|Filmfare Award]] and four [[International Indian Film Academy Awards]].

==Plot==
Shekhar Subramanium, a game designer, has delivered a number of commercial failures; his boss gives him one last chance to develop a successful game. To impress his skeptical son Prateek, Shekhar uses his son's idea that the [[antagonist]] should be more powerful than the [[protagonist]]. Jenny, his colleague, uses Shekhar's face as a model for that of the game's protagonist G.One (short for ''Good One''), while the shape-shifting antagonist Ra.One (short for ''Random Access Version One'' and in Hindi ''[[Ravana|Ravan]]'')&lt;ref name=sss&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/2011/oct/261011-ra-one-shah-rukh-khan-film-review-superhero-film-two-half-stars.htm |title=''Ra.One'' fails to impress |newspaper=Mid-Day |date=26 October 2011 |accessdate=6 June 2012 |author=Shetty-Shah, Shubha |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68DcAXtGs?url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/2011/oct/261011-ra-one-shah-rukh-khan-film-review-superhero-film-two-half-stars.htm |archivedate= 6 June 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; is made faceless. The game contains three levels, the final level being the only one in which either character can be killed. Each character possesses a special device – the ''H.A.R.T'' (Hertz Amplifying Resonance Transmitter), which gives them their powers. Upon reaching the last level, the characters get a gun with one bullet; the opponent can be killed by this bullet but only if his H.A.R.T is attached.

Aakaashi, another colleague, notices unusual glitches but ignores them. When the game is officially launched, it receives a standing ovation from the audience; Prateek insists on playing it immediately. He logs in under the ID ''Lucifer'' and proceeds to the second level, but is interrupted. Ra.One, angry that a player has proceeded so far, determines that Lucifer must die. He uses the wireless technology to enter the real world. Aakaashi informs Shekhar, who rushes home, fearing for his son's life. Aakaashi is murdered by Ra.One, who then takes his appearance and hunts down Lucifer. He meets Shekhar in the process. In an attempt to save his son, Shekhar claims that he is Lucifer, but his lie is exposed when Ra.One scans his identity. He kills Shekhar and makes it look like a car accident.

Sonia, Shekhar's wife, is devastated after his death and decides to return to India. Prateek realises that Ra.One has come to life and was responsible for his father's death. He informs Jenny and she tries to bring G.One into the real world. Ra.One chases Prateek and Sonia on their way in a wild car chase on their way to the airport, but G.One appears, having entered the real world, and causes a gas explosion which temporarily disables Ra.One. G.One takes Ra.One's H.A.R.T. and accompanies the family to [[Mumbai]] after Sonia realises that he can protect her son.

Ra.One returns to life, takes the form of a model ([[Arjun Rampal]]), and tracks down G.One. Hypnotising Sonia, he assumes her form to kidnap Prateek. Ra.One then instructs G.One to give him his H.A.R.T. back, and sends the real Sonia in a malfunctioning [[Mumbai Suburban Railway|local train]]. The train crashes but G.One saves Sonia and the others in time. To save Prateek, he fights Ra.One; both reach the third level. G.One tricks Ra.One into shooting him without his H.A.R.T. attached. Furious, Ra. One creates ten copies of himself. Prateek, unable to identify the real Ra.One, remembers something his father had said to him: &quot;If you join the forces of evil, its shadows shall always follow you&quot;. The duo realise that only one of the ten Ra.Ones has a shadow: the original one. G.One shoots and destroys him with the sole bullet and returns to the virtual world.

Six months later, Prateek and Sonia return to London, where Prateek manages to restore G.One to the real world in remembrance of his late father.

''Ra.One'' was submitted to the [[Central Board of Film Certification]] on 14 October 2011 to receive its viewership rating. The Board raised strong objections to the film's action scenes, fearing that they would influence young children to emulate the stunts.

===Plagiarism allegations===
The film faced allegations of plagiarism with similarities to ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991), the ''[[Batman in film#Christopher Nolan trilogy|Batman]]'' series, ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008), ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010 film)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'' (2010) and ''[[Tron: Legacy]]'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-raones-inspirations/20110919.htm |title=Has ''Ra.One'' been inspired from this? |publisher=Rediff |date=19 September 2011 |accessdate=27 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67EVB1kKl?url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-raones-inspirations/20110919.htm |archivedate=27 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Ra.One'' includes a tribute to Rajinikanth |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/RA-One-includes-a-tribute-to-Rajinikanth/Article1-745104.aspx |work=[[Press Trust of India]] |publisher=[[Hindustan Times]] |accessdate=13 September 2011 |date=13 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679yUfzf5?url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/RA-One-includes-a-tribute-to-Rajinikanth/Article1-745104.aspx |archivedate=24 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan denied the allegations, saying, &quot;I got inspired from a lot of superhero movies but the movie is original.

A few days before the release, screenwriter Yash Patnaik claimed that ''Ra.One'' resembled a concept that he had developed several years before. Patnaik appealed to the [[Bombay High Court]] to delay the film's release, until he was given due credit or 10% of the film's overall profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-10-21/mumbai/30305855_1_tv-writer-advocates-copyright |author=Thomas, Shibu |title=TV writer seeks stay on ''Ra.One'' |newspaper=The Times of India |date=21 October 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679yaDj8T?url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-10-21/mumbai/30305855_1_tv-writer-advocates-copyright |archivedate=24 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court, observing ''prima facie'' evidence that there had been copyright violations, asked the filmmakers to deposit {{INRConvert|10|m}} with the court on 21 October 2011 before releasing the film.

===Hacking===
''Ra.One'' also faced cybertheft and hacking issues.

Reports of a planned sequel of ''Ra.One'' began surfacing prior to the film's release, though the extent of real progress on the sequel is unknown.

Despite Khan's enthusiasm for the idea of a sequel, the film industry expressed mixed opinions regarding it. Filmmaker [[Rajkumar Gupta]] commented, &quot;It would be challenging to take forward a story that has not worked earlier.&quot; Producer [[Ramesh Taurani]] responded negatively to the idea, saying, &quot;It is important for the film to be appreciated so that a sequel can be made.&quot; Trade analyst Atul Mohan called the sequel &quot;a bad idea.&quot; Conversely, others were supportive of the sequel. Producer [[Goldie Behl]] brushed aside arguments about the success of the first film, saying, &quot;If the people think that they can earn some more, then it doesn't matter how big or small the hit was.&quot; Director [[Kunal Kohli]] also reacted positively, saying, &quot;Certain ideas naturally lend themselves to sequels. So why not use that investment of your time and effort to make a sequel that will take the brand further?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;seq&quot; /&gt;
