Miyazaki wrote the script after he decided the film would be based on the 10-year-old daughter of his friend, associate producer Seiji Okuda, who came to visit his house each summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Sunada, Mami (Director)|script-title=ja:夢と狂気の王国|trans-title=The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness|type=Documentary|url=http://yumetokyoki.com|language=Japanese|date=16 November 2013|publisher=Studio Ghibli|location=Tokyo|accessdate=12 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707082237/http://yumetokyoki.com/|archivedate=7 July 2014|df=dmy-all}} Interview with Toshio Suzuki&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Miyazaki was developing two personal projects, but they were rejected.

Lasseter hired [[Kirk Wise]] as director and [[Donald W. Ernst]] as producer of the adaptation. Screenwriters Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES IN FILM ARTICLES SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. --&gt;
Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents are traveling to their new home when her father takes a wrong turn. They unknowingly enter a magical world that Chihiro's father insists on exploring. While Chihiro's parents begin to devour the food at an empty restaurant stall, Chihiro finds an exquisite [[Sentō|bathhouse]] and meets a young boy named Haku who warns her to return across the river before sunset. However, Chihiro discovers too late that her parents have turned into pigs and she is unable to cross the flooded river, becoming trapped in the spirit world.

Haku finds Chihiro and has her ask for a job from the bathhouse's boiler-man, Kamaji, a [[yōkai]] commanding the [[susuwatari]]. Kamaji refuses work for her and asks the worker Lin to send Chihiro to the witch, Yubaba, who runs the bathhouse. Yubaba tries to frighten Chihiro away, but she persists, so Yubaba gives Chihiro a contract to work for her. Yubaba takes her name and renames her {{nihongo|Sen|千}}. While visiting her parents' pigpen, Sen finds a goodbye card addressed to Chihiro and realizes that she has already forgotten her name. Haku warns her that Yubaba controls people by taking their names and that if she forgets hers like he has forgotten his, she will not be able to leave the spirit world.

Sen faces discrimination from the other workers because she is still a human and not a spirit. While working, she invites a silent masked creature named No-Face inside, believing him to be a customer. A 'stink spirit' arrives as Sen's first customer, and she discovers he is the spirit of a polluted river. In gratitude for cleaning him, he gives Sen a magic [[vomiting#emetics|emetic]] [[dumpling]]. Meanwhile, No-Face tempts a worker with gold, then swallows him. He demands food and begins [[gratuity|tipping]] extensively. As the workers swarm him, hoping to be tipped, he swallows two other greedy workers.

Sen discovers paper [[shikigami]] attacking a [[Japanese dragon]] and recognizes the dragon as Haku transformed. When a grievously injured Haku crashes into Yubaba's penthouse, Sen follows him upstairs. A shikigami that stowed away on her back transforms into Zeniba, Yubaba's twin sister. She transforms Yubaba's baby son, Boh, into a mouse, creates a decoy baby and turns Yubaba's harpy into a tiny bird. Zeniba tells Sen that Haku has stolen a magic golden [[Seal (East Asia)|seal]] from her, and warns Sen that it carries a deadly curse. Haku falls into the boiler room with Sen and Boh on his back, where Sen feeds him part of the dumpling with which she intended to save her parents, causing him to vomit both the seal and a black slug, which Sen crushes with her foot.

With Haku unconscious, Sen resolves to return the seal and apologize for Haku. Sen confronts No-Face, who is now massive, and feeds him the rest of the dumpling. No-Face chases Sen out of the bathhouse, steadily regurgitating everything he has eaten. Sen, No-Face, and Boh travel to see Zeniba. Yubaba orders that Sen's parents be slaughtered, but Haku reveals that Boh is missing, and offers to retrieve him if Yubaba releases Sen and her parents. Yubaba agrees, but only if Sen can pass a final test.

Sen, No-Face and Boh meet with the now benevolent Zeniba, who reveals that Sen's love for Haku broke her curse and that Yubaba used the black slug to control Haku. Haku appears at Zeniba’s home in his dragon form and flies Sen and Boh to the bathhouse. No-Face decides to stay behind and becomes Zeniba's [[Spinning (textiles)|spinner]]. In midflight, Sen recalls falling in her youth into the Kohaku River and being washed safely ashore, thus revealing Haku's real identity as the spirit of the Kohaku River. When they arrive at the bathhouse, Yubaba forces Sen to identify her parents from among a group of pigs in order to break their curse. After Sen answers that none of the pigs are her parents, her contract combusts and she is given back her real name. Haku takes her to the now dry riverbed and vows to meet her again. Chihiro crosses the riverbed to her restored parents, who do not remember anything. They quietly walk back to their car, which is now covered in dust and leaves. Before getting in, Chihiro takes a last look back.

|}
Every summer, [[Hayao Miyazaki]] spent his vacation at a mountain cabin with his family and five girls who were friends of the family. The idea for ''Spirited Away'' came about when he wanted to make a film for these friends. Miyazaki had previously directed films for small children and teenagers such as ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'' and ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]'', but he had not created a film for 10-year-old girls. For inspiration, he read [[shōjo manga]] magazines like  ''[[Nakayoshi]]'' and ''[[Ribon]]'' the girls had left at the cabin, but felt they only offered subjects on &quot;crushes&quot; and romance. When looking at his young friends, Miyazaki felt this was not what they &quot;held dear in their hearts&quot; and decided to produce the film about a girl heroine whom they could look up to instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;nausicaa&quot;&gt;[http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/interviews/sen.html Miyazaki on Spirited Away // Interviews //] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6pBCC0x68?url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/interviews/sen.html |date=23 March 2017 }}. Nausicaa.net (11 July 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hayao Miyazaki.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Close up photograph of Hayao Miyazaki, smiling and wearing a suit and tie in front of a gold-colored mosaic.|Writer and director [[Hayao Miyazaki]] used [[shōjo manga]] magazines for inspiration to direct ''Spirited Away''.]]
Miyazaki had wanted to produce a new film for years, but his two previous proposals (one based on the Japanese book ''Kiri no Mukō no Fushigi na Machi'' ({{nihongo|霧のむこうのふしぎな町}}) by Sachiko Kashiwaba, and another about a teenage heroine) were rejected. Miyazaki's third proposal, which ended up becoming ''Sen and Chihiro Spirited Away'', was more successful. The three stories revolved around a bathhouse that was inspired by one in Miyazaki's hometown. Miyazaki thought the bathhouse was a mysterious place, and there was a small door next to one of the bathtubs in the bathhouse. Miyazaki was always curious to what was behind it, and he made up several stories about it, one of which inspired the bathhouse setting of ''Spirited Away''.&lt;ref name=&quot;nausicaa&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Ogata Gekko - Ryu sho ten edit.jpg|thumb|A [[Japanese dragon]] ascends towards the heavens with [[Mount Fuji]] in the background in this print from [[Ogata Gekkō]].

Production of ''Spirited Away'' commenced in 2000 on a budget of ¥1.9 billion ($15 million).&lt;ref name=&quot;howe&quot; /&gt; Disney invested 10% of the cost for the [[right of first refusal]] for American distribution.&lt;ref name=&quot;fps&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpsmagazine.com/comment/spirited.php|title=Spirited Away by Miyazaki|publisher=FPS Magazine|accessdate=11 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519193618/http://www.fpsmagazine.com/comment/spirited.php|archivedate=19 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'', Miyazaki and the [[Studio Ghibli]] staff experimented with computer animation. With the use of more computers and programs such as [[Autodesk Softimage|Softimage]], the staff learned the software, but used the technology carefully so that it enhanced the story, instead of 'stealing the show'. Each character was mostly hand-drawn, with Miyazaki working alongside his animators to see they were getting it just right.&lt;ref name=&quot;howe&quot;&gt;[http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/michael_howe/archive/2003/04/15/1391.aspx The Making of Hayao Miyazaki's &quot;Spirited Away&quot;&amp;nbsp;– Part 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312093531/http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/michael_howe/archive/2003/04/15/1391.aspx |date=12 March 2009 }}. Jimhillmedia.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest difficulty in making the film was to reduce its length. When production started, Miyazaki realized it would be more than three hours long if he made it according to his plot. He had to delete many scenes from the story, and tried to reduce the &quot;eye-candy&quot; in the film because he wanted it to be simple. Miyazaki did not want to make the hero a &quot;pretty girl.&quot; At the beginning, he was frustrated at how she looked &quot;dull&quot; and thought, &quot;She isn't cute. Isn't there something we can do?&quot; As the film neared the end, however, he was relieved to feel &quot;she will be a charming woman.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nausicaa&quot;/&gt;

He often visited the museum for inspiration while working on the film. Miyazaki had always been interested in the Pseudo-Western style buildings from the [[Meiji period]] that were available there. The museum made Miyazaki feel nostalgic, &quot;especially when I stand here alone in the evening, near closing time, and the sun is setting&amp;nbsp;– tears well up in my eyes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nausicaa&quot;/&gt; Another major inspiration was the Notoya Ryokan ({{nihongo|能登谷旅館}}), a [[Ryokan (Japanese inn)|traditional Japanese inn]] located in [[Yamagata Prefecture]], famous for its exquisite architecture and ornamental features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tenkai-japan.com/2010/05/29/notoya-in-ginzan-onsen-stop-businees-for-renovation/ |title=Notoya in Ginzan Onsen stop business for renovation. &amp;#124; Tenkai-japan:Cool Japan Guide-Travel, Shopping, Fashion, J-pop |publisher=Tenkai-japan |date=1 July 2010 |accessdate=6 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028211832/http://www.tenkai-japan.com/2010/05/29/notoya-in-ginzan-onsen-stop-businees-for-renovation/ |archivedate=28 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some guidebooks and articles claim that the old gold town of [[Jiufen]] in Taiwan served as an inspirational model for the film, Miyazaki has denied this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Focus Newspaper: Hayao Miyazaki, 72 year old Mischievous Youngster (from 3:00 mark)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ9BnbkRzOg|publisher=TVBS TV|accessdate=5 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710213935/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ9BnbkRzOg|archivedate=10 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dōgo Onsen]] is also often said to be a key inspiration for the Spirited Away onsen/bathhouse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5502.html Dogo Onsen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613043628/http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5502.html |date=13 June 2009 }} japan-guide.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music and soundtrack===
The [[film score]] of ''Spirited Away'' was composed and conducted by Miyazaki's regular collaborator [[Joe Hisaishi]], and performed by the [[New Japan Philharmonic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Record&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/miyazakis-spirited-away-film-score-mw0000223876|title=Miyazaki's Spirited Away|publisher=Milan Records|date=10 September 2002|medium=CD|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219131028/http://www.allmusic.com/album/miyazakis-spirited-away-film-score-mw0000223876|archivedate=19 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack received awards at the 56th Mainichi Film Competition Award for Best Music, the [[Tokyo International Anime Fair]] 2001 Best Music Award in the Theater Movie category, and the 17th Japan Gold Disk Award for Animation Album of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/enta/cinema/mfa/etc/history/56.html|title=第56回 日本映画大賞 (56th Japan Movie Awards)|work=Mainichi Shimbun|accessdate=1 September 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215183416/http://mainichi.jp/enta/cinema/mfa/etc/history/56.html|archivedate=15 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2002/02/19/results-from-tokyo-anime-fair-awards/ |title=Results From Tokyo Anime Fair Awards |publisher=Anime Nation |date=19 February 2002 |accessdate=1 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006114030/http://www.animenation.net/blog/2002/02/19/results-from-tokyo-anime-fair-awards/ |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/e/data/gdisc/2002.html|title=The 17th Japan Gold Disc Award 2002|publisher=Recording Industry Association of Japan|accessdate=1 September 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006093734/http://www.riaj.or.jp/e/data/gdisc/2002.html|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Hisaishi added lyrics to &quot;One Summer's Day&quot; and named the new version {{nihongo|&quot;The Name of Life&quot;|いのちの名前|&quot;Inochi no Namae&quot;}} which was performed by [[Ayaka Hirahara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ayaka-hirahara.com/discography/banka_s.html |title=晩夏(ひとりの季節)/いのちの名前 (The name of life/late summer) |publisher=Ayaka Hirahara |accessdate=1 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215184400/http://www.ayaka-hirahara.com/discography/banka_s.html |archivedate=15 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English adaptation===
Both [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and [[DreamWorks]] bid for the US distribution rights.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Eventually, [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] won the rights to dub the English adaptation of ''Spirited Away'', under the supervision of [[Pixar]] animator [[John Lasseter]]. A Miyazaki fan, Lasseter would sit with his staff and watch Miyazaki's work when encountering story problems, and at one point they did so with ''Spirited Away'', which impressed Lasseter.&lt;ref name=&quot;howe3&quot; /&gt; Upon hearing his reaction to the film, people at Disney asked Lasseter if he would be interested in trying to bring ''Spirited Away'' to an American audience. Lasseter agreed to be the executive producer for English adaptation. Soon, several others began to join the project: ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' co-director [[Kirk Wise]] and ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' co-producer [[Donald W. Ernst]] joined Lasseter as director and producer of ''Spirited Away'' respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;howe3&quot;&gt;[http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/michael_howe/archive/2003/04/16/1393.aspx The Making of Hayao Miyazaki's &quot;Spirited Away&quot;&amp;nbsp;– Part 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317040600/http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/michael_howe/archive/2003/04/16/1393.aspx |date=17 March 2009 }}. Jimhillmedia.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt penned the English language dialogue, which they wrote to match the characters' original Japanese language lip movements.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

The cast of the film consisted of [[Daveigh Chase]], [[Jason Marsden]], [[Susan Egan]], [[David Ogden Stiers]], and [[John Ratzenberger]]. Advertising was limited, and ''Spirited Away'' was only mentioned in a small scrolling section of their film page on Disney's official website. Disney had sidelined their official website for ''Spirited Away'',&lt;ref name=&quot;howe3&quot; /&gt; and given the film
a comparatively small promotional budget.&lt;ref name=fps /&gt; Marc Hairston argues that this was a justified response to Ghibli's retention of the merchandising rights to the film and characters, which limited Disney's ability to properly market the film.&lt;ref name=fps /&gt;

==Themes==
The themes of the film are heavily influenced by Japanese Shinto-Buddhist folklore.  The central location of the film is a Japanese bathhouse where a great variety of Japanese folklore creatures, including [[kami]], come to bathe.  Miyasaki cites the solstice rituals when villagers call forth their local kami and invite them into their baths.&lt;ref&gt;''Shinto Perspectives in Miyazaki's Anime Film &quot;Spirited Away''
&quot;, Shinto Perspectives in Miyazaki's Anime Film, &quot;Spirited Away&quot;, Volume 8, James W. Boyd, Tetsuya Nishimura, Issue 3 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Chihiro also encounters kami of animals and plants. Miyazaki says of this: &quot;In my
grandparents' time, it was believed that [[kami]] existed everywhere -- in trees, rivers, insects, wells, anything. My generation does not believe this, but I like the idea that we should all treasure everything because spirits might exist there, and we should treasure everything because there is a kind of life to everything.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Shinto Perspectives in Miyazaki's Anime Film &quot;Spirited Away''
&quot;, Shinto Perspectives in Miyazaki's Anime Film, &quot;Spirited Away&quot;, Volume 8, James W. Boyd, Tetsuya Nishimura, Issue 3 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has been compared to [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' as the stories have some elements in common such being set in a fantasy world, the plots including a disturbance in logic and stability, and there being motifs such as food having transformational qualities; though developments and themes are not shared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/3975727|work=moviepilot.com|author=Sunny Bay|date=22 June 2016|title=Beyond Wonderland: 'Spirited Away' Explores The Significance Of Dreams In The Real World|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814000655/http://moviepilot.com/posts/3975727|archivedate=14 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spark&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/film/spiritedaway/section5.rhtml|work=sparknotes.com|title=&quot;SparkNote on Spirited Away.&quot; Influences on the Film |date=2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814185733/http://www.sparknotes.com/film/spiritedaway/section5.rhtml|archivedate=14 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other stories compared to ''Spirited Away'', ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' is seen to be more closely linked thematically.&lt;ref name=Spark/&gt;

The major [[Theme (arts)|themes]] of ''Spirited Away'' center on the protagonist Chihiro and her [[Liminality|liminal]] journey through the realm of spirits. The [[archetype|archetypal]] entrance into another world demarcates Chihiro's status as one somewhere between child and adult. Chihiro also stands outside societal boundaries in the supernatural setting. The use of the word [[kamikakushi]] (literally &quot;hidden by gods&quot;) within the Japanese title, and its associated folklore, reinforces this liminal passage: &quot;Kamikakushi is a verdict of 'social death' in this world, and coming back to this world from Kamikakushi meant 'social resurrection.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;reider&quot;&gt;Reider, Noriko T. &quot;Spirited Away: Film of the Fantastic and Evolving Japanese Folk Symbols.&quot; Film Criticism 29.3: 4–27. Academic OneFile. Gale. 11 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yubaba has many similarities to [[The Coachman]] from ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', in the sense that she transforms humans into pigs in a similar way that the boys of [[Pleasure Island (Pinocchio)|Pleasure Island]] were transformed into donkeys. Upon gaining employment at the bathhouse, Yubaba's seizure of Chihiro's [[true name]] symbolically kills the child,&lt;ref name=&quot;satoshi3&quot;&gt;Satoshi, Ando. &quot;Regaining Continuity with the Past: Spirited Away and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.&quot; [[Bookbird]] 46.1: 23–29. Project MUSE. 11 February 2009 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/bookbird/v046/46.1.satoshi.pdf]{{subscription required}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who must then assume adulthood. She then undergoes a [[rite of passage]] according to the [[monomyth]] format; to recover continuity with her past, Chihiro must create a new identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;satoshi3&quot; /&gt;

Along with its function within the ostensible [[coming of age]] theme, Yubaba's act of taking Chihiro's name and replacing it with Sen (an alternate reading of &quot;chi&quot;, the first character in Chihiro's name - lit. &quot;one thousand&quot;), is symbolic of capitalism's single-minded concern with value, reflecting the film's exploration of capitalism and its effect on traditional Japanese culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;napier&quot;&gt;[[Susan J. Napier|Napier, Susan J.]] &quot;Matter Out of Place: Carnival, Containment and Cultural Recovery in Miyazaki's Spirited Away.&quot; [[Journal of Japanese Studies]] 32.2: 287–310. Project MUSE. 11 February 2009 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_japanese_studies/v032/32.2napier.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

Yubaba is stylistically unique within the bathhouse, wearing Western dress and living among European décor and furnishings, in contrast with the minimalist Japanese style of her employee's quarters, representing the Western capitalist influence over Japan in its [[Meiji period]] and beyond. The Meiji design of the abandoned theme park is the setting for Chihiro's parents' transformation - the family arrives in an imported [[Audi]] car and the father wears a European style polo shirt, reassuring Chihiro that he has &quot;credit cards and cash&quot;, before their morphing into literal consumerist pigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quia.com/files/quia/users/bakersensei/ext_japanese1.pdf|title=HSC Extension course|publisher=New South Wales Department of Education and Training|format=PDF|accessdate=7 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130074502/https://www.quia.com/files/quia/users/bakersensei/ext_japanese1.pdf|archivedate=30 January 2017|df=dmy-all}} {{unreliable source?|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Spirited Away'' contains critical commentary on modern Japanese society concerning generational conflicts and environmental issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;napier&quot;/&gt; Chihiro has been seen as a representation of the [[shōjo]], whose roles and ideology had changed dramatically since post-war Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;napier&quot;/&gt;

Hiyasaki has stated:''Chihiro’s parents turning into pigs symbolizes how some humans become greedy.   At the very moment Chihiro says there is something odd about this town, her parents turn into pigs.  There were people that &quot;turned into pigs&quot; during Japan’s [[bubble economy]] ([[Consumerism#Consumerism as cultural ideology|consumer society]]) of the 1980s, and these people still haven’t realized they’ve become pigs.  Once someone becomes a pig, they don’t return to being human but instead gradually start to have the &quot;body and soul of a pig&quot;.  These people are the ones saying, ‘We are in a recession and don’t have enough to eat.' This doesn’t just apply to the fantasy world.    Perhaps this isn’t a coincidence and the food is actually (an analogy for) &quot;a trap to catch lost humans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://en.rocketnews24.com/2016/07/14/studio-ghibli-letter-sheds-new-light-on-spirited-away-mysteries/ | title=Studio Ghibli letter sheds new light on Spirited Away mysteries | first=Corey | last=Gold | date=14 July 2016 | publisher=SoraNews24 | accessdate=24 April 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6pBu62PVe?url=http://en.rocketnews24.com/2016/07/14/studio-ghibli-letter-sheds-new-light-on-spirited-away-mysteries/ | archivedate=24 March 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as Chihiro seeks her past identity, Japan, in its anxiety over the economic downturn occurring during the release of the film in 2001, sought to reconnect to past values.&lt;ref name=&quot;satoshi3&quot;/&gt; In an interview, Miyazaki has commented on this nostalgic element for an old Japan.&lt;ref name=midnight-eye&gt;{{cite web|last=Mes|first=Tom|title=Hayao Miyazaki Interview|work=Midnight Eye|date=7 January 2002|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/interviews/hayao_miyazaki.shtml|accessdate=1 August 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802193550/http://www.midnighteye.com/interviews/hayao_miyazaki.shtml|archivedate=2 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the bathhouse of the spirits cannot be seen as a place free of ambiguity and darkness.&lt;ref name=&quot;thrupkaew&quot;&gt;Thrupkaew, Noy. &quot;Animation Sensation: Why Japan's Magical Spirited Away Plays Well Anywhere.&quot; [[American Prospect]] 13.19: 32–33. Academic OneFile. Gale. 11 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present;&lt;ref name=&quot;napier&quot;/&gt; it is a place of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of the No-Face.&lt;ref name=&quot;harris&quot;&gt;Harris, Timothy. &quot;Seized by the Gods.&quot; [[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]] 47.9: 64–67. Academic OneFile. Gale. 11 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In stark contrast to the simplicity of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constant chaotic carnival in the background.&lt;ref name=&quot;napier&quot;/&gt;

There are two major instances of allusions to environmental issues within the movie. The first is seen when Chihiro is dealing with the &quot;stink spirit.&quot; The stink spirit was actually a river spirit, but it was so corrupted with filth that one couldn't tell what it was at first glance. It only became clean again when Chihiro pulled out a huge amount of trash, including car tires, garbage, and a bicycle. This alludes to human pollution of the environment, and how people can carelessly toss away things without thinking of the consequences and of where the trash will go. The second allusion is seen in Haku himself. Haku does not remember his name and lost his past, which is why he is stuck at the bathhouse. Eventually, Chihiro remembers that he used to be the spirit of the Kohaku River, which was destroyed and replaced with apartments. Because of humans' need for development, they destroyed a part of nature, causing Haku to lose his home and identity. This can be compared to deforestation and desertification; humans tear down nature, cause imbalance in the ecosystem, and demolish animals' homes to satisfy their want for more space (housing, malls, stores, etc.) but don't think about how it can affect other living things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saporito|first1=Jeff|title=What does &quot;Spirited Away&quot; say about Environmentalism?|url=http://screenprism.com/insights/article/what-does-spirited-away-say-about-environmentalism|website=ScreenPrism|accessdate=1 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303201035/http://screenprism.com/insights/article/what-does-spirited-away-say-about-environmentalism|archivedate=3 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional themes are expressed through the No-Face, who reflects the characters which surround him, learning by example and taking the traits of whomever he consumes. This nature results in No-Face's monstrous rampage through the bath house. After Chihiro saves No-Face with the emetic dumpling, he becomes timid once more. At the end of the film, Zeniba decides to take care of No-Face so he can develop without the negative influence of the bathhouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web41.its.hawaii.edu/manoa.hawaii.edu/eastasia/wp/wp-content/uploads/2004/10/spiritedaway.pdf|title=Lesson Plan&amp;nbsp;— Spirited Away|publisher=UHM|accessdate=12 August 2013|author=Gomes, Paul|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105170315/http://web41.its.hawaii.edu/manoa.hawaii.edu/eastasia/wp/wp-content/uploads/2004/10/spiritedaway.pdf|archivedate=5 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
