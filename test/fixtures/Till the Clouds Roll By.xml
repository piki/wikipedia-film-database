'''''Till The Clouds Roll By''''' is a 1946 American [[Technicolor]] [[musical film]] produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. It is a fictionalized [[biopic]] of composer [[Jerome Kern]], portrayed by [[Robert Walker (actor, born 1918)|Robert Walker]]. Kern was originally involved with the production, but died before it was completed. It has a large cast of well-known musical stars of the day who appear performing Kern's songs. It was the first in a series of MGM biopics about Broadway's composers; it was followed by ''[[Words and Music (1948 film)|Words and Music]]'' ([[Rodgers and Hart]], 1948), ''[[Three Little Words (film)|Three Little Words]]'' ([[Kalmar and Ruby]], 1950), and ''[[Deep in My Heart (1954 film)|Deep in My Heart]]'' ([[Sigmund Romberg]], 1954).&lt;ref name=&quot;Levy2007&quot;/&gt;

The film is one of the MGM musicals that entered the [[public domain]] on their 28th anniversaries because MGM did not renew their copyrights.

==Production==
[[File:TillCloudsRollBy01.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Lena Horne]] as Julie Laverne in a mini-production of ''[[Show Boat]]'', singing &quot;[[Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man]]&quot;. ]]

The working title for the film was &quot;As the Clouds Roll By&quot;.&lt;ref name=afi /&gt;  [[Gene Kelly]] was originally intended to play Kern, with [[Gloria DeHaven]], [[Jacqueline White]], Imogene Carpenter, a stage actress, and [[Jeanette MacDonald]] in major parts. None appeared in the film.&lt;ref name=afi /&gt;

The first 15 minutes of the film consist of a condensed adaptation of Act I of ''[[Show Boat]]'', with the order of some of the songs shifted - &quot;Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man&quot; is sung after &quot;Life upon the Wicked Stage&quot;, and &quot;Ol' Man River&quot; was used as an Act I Finale, dissimilar to the show.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} &quot;Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man&quot; as sung by [[Lena Horne]] was filmed, like many of her other musical numbers in MGM films, so that it could be easily removed from the print by sensitive Southern distributors.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

When the film started production in the fall of 1945, [[Judy Garland]] was signed as Broadway singer-dancer [[Marilyn Miller]], having just returned to California after a long New York honeymoon with her new husband, director [[Vincente Minnelli]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Levy2007&quot;/&gt;  Soon after, Kern returned to New York towards the end of October and died in November 1945.

During the six months that it took to shoot the film, producer [[Arthur Freed]] had to come up with one director after another. Lemuel Ayers, a set designer, was originally scheduled to make his directorial debut on the film, but was replaced by [[Busby Berkeley]] late in August 1945. Meanwhile, Minnelli &amp;ndash; who, it was rumored at the time, would be taking over the direction of the film &amp;ndash; was shooting Garland's sequences even before the beginning of [[principal photography]], as she was pregnant and expected to give birth in March 1946; her shooting was completed on November 8, 1945. By the time full shooting began in the middle of December, Berkeley had been replaced by [[Henry Koster]], who was also replaced after a short period by [[Richard Whorf]]. Whorf ended up receiving the onscreen directorial credit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levy2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=afi /&gt; There was a break in production from some time in January 1946 to the middle of March of that year.&lt;ref name=afi /&gt;

The film includes two versions of &quot;Ol' Man River&quot; - the first sung by Caleb Peterson and an African-American chorus as part of the ''Show Boat'' medley, and the second, a &quot;[[crooner]] version&quot; by [[Frank Sinatra]], featured as the grand finale.

[[Barbette (performer)|Barbette]] consulted on the creation of the film's circus sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Surviving Judy Garland song outtake===
A video of an excised musical number survives from this film, although part of the soundtrack has been lost. Judy Garland, as Marilyn Miller, sings &quot;D'Ya Love Me?&quot; to two clowns in a circus setting, representing a scene from the [[Broadway musical]] ''[[Sunny (musical)|Sunny]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfutAMxA5qk Judy Garland in outtake from ''Till the Clouds Roll By'' (1946); soundtrack partially missing] on [[YouTube]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack album==

The film was one of the first motion pictures to have a [[soundtrack album]] released concurrent with it arriving in theaters.  The soundtrack was produced by MGM Records. It originally contained four 78-rpm records featuring various artists and songs from the film and front-cover artwork by [[Lennie Hayton]].  Later the album was released on [[LP album|LP]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/461/Till-the-Clouds-Roll-By/trivia.html &quot;Trivia&quot;] [[TCM.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

No official authorized version has yet been released on [[CD]], but several unauthorized versions have ([[Rhino Entertainment]] currently owns the rights to issue an authorized CD of the soundtrack, under license from [[Turner Entertainment]]; in the past, [[MCA Records]] and [[Sony Music Entertainment]] held such rights). This is due to MGM allowing the film to fall into public domain.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
[[Bosley Crowther]], reviewing the film for ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= 'Till Clouds Roll By,' Musical Biography of Life of Jerome Kern With Robert Walker in Title Role, at the Music Hall |date= December 6, 1946|publisher= The New York Times||url= https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B02E6D71E3AEE3BBC4E53DFB467838D659EDE| first=Bosley |last=Crowther| authorlink= Bosley Crowther| accessdate= 2015-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Why did [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|Metro]]...have to cook up a thoroughly phoney yarn about the struggles of a chirpy young composer to carry the lovely songs of [[Jerome Kern|Jerry Kern]]? And why did it have to do it in such a hackneyed and sentimental way as to grate on the sensibilities of even the most affectionately disposed?&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' began its review with a similar sentiment: &quot;Why quibble about the story?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff| title= Review: ‘Till the Clouds Roll by’|date= December 31, 1945|newspaper= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] ||url= https://variety.com/1945/film/reviews/till-the-clouds-roll-by-1200414636/| accessdate= 2015-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
The film earned $4,748,000 in the US and Canada box office and $1,976,000 elsewhere, but because of its high cost the profit was only $732,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mannix&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/variety169-1948-01#page/n62/mode/1up &quot;Top Grossers of 1947&quot;, ''Variety'', 7 January 1948 p 63]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
The film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:
* 2006: [[AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals]] – Nominated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/musicals_ballot.pdf |title= AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals Nominees |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home media==
The film is one of several MGM musicals &amp;ndash; another being ''[[Royal Wedding]]'' &amp;ndash; that [[List of films in the public domain in the United States|entered the public domain]] 28 years after production because the studio did not renew the [[copyright registration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Pierce |date=June 2007 |title=Forgotten Faces: Why Some of Our Cinema Heritage Is Part of the Public Domain  |journal=Film History: An International Journal |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=125–43 |issn=0892-2160 |oclc=15122313 |doi=10.2979/FIL.2007.19.2.125 |jstor=25165419 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it is one of the most widely circulated MGM musicals on home video. [[Warner Home Video]] gave it its first fully restored DVD release on April 25, 2006.
