'''''The Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler''''' is a 1971 [[science fiction film]] directed by Bob Wynn and starring [[Leslie Nielsen]], [[Bradford Dillman]] and [[Angie Dickinson]]. This was one of the earliest films to depict medical exploitation of [[cloning]], even though the term was not used.&lt;ref name=earlyuse/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clone&gt;{{cite web |work=[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]] |title=Clones |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/clones |date=April 22, 2015 |accessdate=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shot on [[videotape]] and transferred to film for theatrical and TV release.&lt;ref name=Variety&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kgMIAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Zachary+wheeler&amp;dq=Zachary+wheeler |title=Variety's Complete Science Fiction Reviews |first=Donald C. |last=Willis |publisher=Garland |date=January 1, 1985 |page=274 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold Key Entertainment commissioned this film at the same time as it commissioned the film ''[[The Day of the Wolves]]'', and tried to persuade Ferde Grofe to film that on video because of the cost savings, but he declined. 

==Plot==
Reporter Harry Walsh ([[Leslie Nielsen|Nielsen]]) witnesses an auto accident in which two people are killed. Recognizing the survivor as Senator Clayton Zachary Wheeler, ([[Bradford Dillman|Dillman]]) he rides with him in the ambulance.

After he reports Wheeler's accident from the hospital, the staff tells him there is no such person admitted. Walsh's editor orders him to retract his story, which he refuses to do, at the cost of his job. Some detective work leads him to [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]].

Meanwhile, Wheeler wakes up in a secret hospital run by Dr. Redding ([[James Daly (actor)|Daly]]) and Dr. Layle Johnson ([[Angie Dickinson|Dickinson]]). He finds out he is the recipient of an incredible transplant, utilizing organs harvested from &quot;somas&quot;. These somas are bodies artificially grown from his own [[DNA]].

Walsh has to elude two less-than-brilliant agents on his way to Alamogordo, finally escaping them, traveling with some migrant workers. Wheeler learns that the &quot;fee&quot; for his surgery is to do whatever he can do as Senator, for the Committee—a form of medical blackmail. Fielding, ([[Robert J. Wilke|Wilke]]) the Committee chairman, refers to it as &quot;a new type of money.&quot; Wheeler refuses to cooperate and threatens to turn the whole operation in. Fielding warns him he will never win a presidential nomination if news of his heart transplant gets out.

In Alamogordo, Walsh deduces that Wheeler's plane must have gone to [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos]], site of the old [[Manhattan Project]]. With the help of a newspaper buddy, he lands at the base and discovers an extra soma of Wheeler. Thinking it to be the senator, he breaks it out and commandeers Dr. Johnson's car.

The car wrecks when Walsh swerves to avoid hitting several somas wandering around. Johnson is injured, and Fielding tries to use the situation to change Wheeler's position, threatening not to save her. As Wheeler has grown fond of her, his resolve is weakening, but Redding assures him she is not badly injured.

Walsh and Wheeler finally meet, and agree to expose the Committee together, even as Fielding and Redding discuss a new &quot;client&quot; they have been hoping for.

==Production==
[[Tom Rolf]] got the idea for the film reading about organ transplants in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''. At the time he was [[production coordinator]] on the TV series ''[[The Big Valley]]''. Rolf told his friend Jay Simms, a writer on the series, about his idea. Together they wrote the film in about three weeks. They gave the script to Simms' agent, who liked it. Rolf felt that despite the low budget, the film was ahead of its time, and was pleased with it. Rolf was normally an editor and this film was his only writing credit.&lt;ref name=Rolf&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067669/reviews?ref_=tt_urv |title=A Film Way Ahead of its Time |first=Tom |last=Rolf |date=November 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name used for the clones, soma, is Greek for &quot;body&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;greekwords&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Athanase (Tom) |last=Tzouchas |title=Examples of Power Learning |work=Greek Words |publisher=Trafford Publishing |isbn=978-1-4907-2610-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrwSBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;ots=9F8JKhu9Hm&amp;dq=some%20greek%20word%20for%20body&amp;pg=PA29 |page=29 |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Soma&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/soma Soma] at [http://dictionary.reference.com Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; They share the name with the hallucinogenic drug used by the urbanites in [[Aldous Huxley]]'s 1932 novel, ''[[Brave New World]]''.&lt;ref name= Tech-noir&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Tech_noir_Film.html?id=385SDKrMdMoC |title=Tech-noir Film; A Theory of the Development of Popular Genres |page=404 |first=Emily E. |last=Auger |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Brave&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=niDNtZoYsAUC&amp;printsec=PA54 Brave New World] Aldous Huxley, 1932 page 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The film is noted as possibly the earliest to depict surgical transplants using clones for parts.&lt;ref name=earlyuse&gt;{{cite book |last1=Macintosh |first1=Kerry Lynn |title=Human Cloning: Four Fallacies and Their Legal Consequences |date=2013 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=1107031850 |page=152 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NRE6aKXrTWAC&amp;pg=PA152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Clone/&gt;

According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', this was the first American film to be shot on [[videotape]] and transferred to film for release.&lt;ref name=Variety/&gt; Actually, there had been others, such as ''[[T.A.M.I.
