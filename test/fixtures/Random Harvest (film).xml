'''''Random Harvest''''' is a 1942 film based on the 1941 [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]] [[Random Harvest|novel of the same name]], directed by [[Mervyn LeRoy]]. [[Claudine West]], [[George Froeschel]], and [[Arthur Wimperis]] adapted the novel for the screen, and received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination. The film departed from the novel in several significant ways, as it proved nearly impossible to translate to film otherwise. It starred [[Ronald Colman]] as a [[Combat stress reaction|shellshocked]], [[amnesia]]c World War I soldier, and [[Greer Garson]] as his love interest.

It was an instant commercial success. Its seven [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations included nods for Colman, supporting actress [[Susan Peters]], director [[Mervyn LeRoy]], and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. Garson, whose performance was well-received, was ineligible for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], as she had already been nominated that year for her role in ''[[Mrs. Miniver]]''.

==Plot==
&quot;John Smith&quot; (Ronald Colman) is a British officer who was [[Poison gas|gassed]] and became [[shell shock]]ed in the [[Trench warfare|trenches]] during the [[First World War]]. He is confined to an asylum as an unidentified inmate because he has lost his memory and has trouble speaking. When the war ends, the gatekeepers abandon their posts to join the celebration in the nearby town of Melbridge. With no one to stop him, Smith simply wanders off.

[[File:Greer Garson in Random Harvest trailer 2.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Greer Garson from the trailer for ''Random Harvest'']]
In town, he is befriended by singer Paula Ridgeway (Greer Garson). She assumes he is from the asylum, but as he seems harmless, she arranges for him to join her traveling theatrical group. After an incident that threatens to bring unwanted attention, Paula takes Smith away to a secluded country village, where they marry and are blissfully happy.

&quot;Smithy&quot;, as Paula calls him, discovers a literary talent and tries writing to earn a living. Paula remains home with their newborn baby while Smithy goes to [[Liverpool]] for a job interview with a newspaper. There, he is struck by a taxi. When he regains consciousness, his past memory is restored, but his life with Paula is now forgotten. He is Charles Rainier, the son of a wealthy businessman. None of his meager possessions, including a key, provide any clue how he got there from the battleground of France.

Charles returns home on the day of his father's funeral, to the family's amazement as he had been given up for dead. Fifteen-year-old Kitty ([[Susan Peters]]), the stepdaughter of one of Charles' siblings, becomes infatuated with her &quot;uncle&quot;.

Charles wants to return to college, but the mismanaged family business needs him, and he puts off his own desires to safeguard the jobs of the many employees and to restore the family fortune. After a few years, a newspaper touts him as the &quot;Industrial Prince of England&quot;.

Meanwhile, Paula has been searching for her Smithy. Their son having died as an infant, she returns to work as a secretary. One day, she sees Charles' picture in a newspaper and manages to become his executive assistant, calling herself Margaret Hanson (Paula being her stage name), hoping that her presence will jog his memory. Her confidant and admirer, Dr. Jonathan Benet ([[Phillip Dorn]]), warns her that revealing her identity would only cause Charles to resent her.

As Kitty grows up, she sends Charles love letters. Eventually, they become engaged. Margaret has Smithy [[Declared death in absentia|declared legally dead]], seven years having elapsed since he left her, dissolving their marriage. However, a hymn that Kitty is considering for their upcoming wedding triggers a vague memory in Charles. Kitty realizes that he still loves someone else and, heartbroken, breaks off the engagement.
 
When Margaret hears Charles is in Liverpool, trying one last time to piece together his lost years, she rushes there. They recover his suitcase from a hotel, but he recognizes nothing. Charles is then approached to stand for [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]. After his election, in which Margaret provides invaluable assistance, he feels the need for a wife in his new role. He proposes to her, more as a business proposition than a romantic one, and she accepts.

They become an ideal couple, at least to all outward appearances. She is the perfect society hostess. In a moment of reflection, they discuss his lost past, and she tells him of her own lost love, without revealing that it is Charles. He hopes their life together can fill the void they both feel. Miserably alone and desperately unhappy, Margaret decides to take an extended vacation abroad by herself. Before her [[Ocean liner|liner]] sails, she revisits the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] where she and Smithy lived.

As Charles is seeing Margaret off at the train station, he is summoned to mediate a strike at the Melbridge Cable Works. After the successful negotiation and the resulting announcement to the factory workers, he walks through the town, and the familiar surroundings and celebrations begin to unlock his lost memories and eventually lead him to the cottage he and Paula shared. Hesitantly, he tries the old key he kept, and finds that it unlocks the door.

Margaret, who had been about to leave for her boat, makes a casual remark to the current innkeeper about the former innkeeper. The innkeeper tells her that a gentleman just that morning had inquired about the former innkeeper, the old vicar, and had mentioned that he used to rent a cottage near a church. With newfound hope, Margaret hurries to the cottage and finds Charles standing at the unlocked door. When she calls him &quot;Smithy,&quot; his memory floods back and he cries out &quot;Paula!&quot; as he rushes to embrace her.

==Reception==
According to MGM records, the film earned $8,147,000 and made a profit of $4,384,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mannix&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;scott&quot;&gt;{{cite book| first=Scott| last=Eyman| title=Lion of Hollywood: The Life and Legend of Louis B.

Despite its box office success, critics were not impressed at the time. [[James Agee]] wrote, &quot;I would like to recommend this film to those who can stay interested in Ronald Colman's amnesia for two hours and who can with pleasure eat a bowl of Yardley's shaving soap for breakfast.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Film Snob's Dictionary: An Essential Lexicon of Filmological Knowledge |last1=Kamp |first1=David |last2=Levi |first2=Lawrence |year=2006 |publisher=Random House |location= |isbn=978-0767918763 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z0WY_UVe44UC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22I+would+like+to+recommend+this+film+to+those+who+can+stay+interested%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p25GgX25tS&amp;sig=nHIOFIGzZAEX3dAtxyzllqRl0bo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wsVGUpOJHeTgyQHdt4GwAQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%20would%20like%20to%20recommend%20this%20film%20to%20those%20who%20can%20stay%20interested%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[New York Times]]'' review, [[Bosley Crowther]] was of the opinion that &quot;for all its emotional excess, ''Random Harvest'' is a strangely empty film.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |title=Random Harvest (1942) |first=Bosley |last=Crowther |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 18, 1942 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9804E5DC1039E33BBC4052DFB4678389659EDE&amp;partner=Rotten%20Tomatoes}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Miss Garson and Mr. Colman are charming; they act perfectly. But they never seem real.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the performances of the two leads, in particular Garson, but noted that Colman seemed older than the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://variety.com/1941/film/reviews/random-harvest-2-1200413836/ |title=Review: &quot;Random Harvest&quot; |newspaper=Variety |date=December 31, 1941 |accessdate=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decades later, [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' allowed that it had &quot;a kind of deranged sincerity and integrity on its own terms&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosenbaum |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/random-harvest/Film?oid=1074697 |title=Random Harvest |newspaper=Chicago Reader |accessdate=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Maltin]]'s capsule review reads &quot;James Hilton novel given supremely entertaining MGM treatment, with Colman and Garson at their best.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Random Harvest (1942) |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |website=Turner Classic Movies |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2716/Random-Harvest/}} 3.5/4.0 stars.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hal Erickson (author)|Hal Erickson]] wrote, &quot;Under normal circumstances, we wouldn't believe a minute of ''Random Harvest'', but the magic spell woven by the stars and by author James Hilton (''Lost Horizon'', ''Goodbye Mr. Chips'' etc.) transforms the wildly incredible into the wholly credible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Random Harvest (1942) |last=Erickson |first=Hal |website=[[AllMovie]] |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v40277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was ranked 36th by the [[American Film Institute]] in its 2002 [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions]] list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/passions100.pdf |website=American Film Institute |accessdate=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This film is alluded to in the third season of British sitcom ''[[As Time Goes By (UK TV series)|As Time Goes By]]''. Lionel and Jean attend a meeting in Los Angeles about a script he has written, and co-executive creative consultants Josh and Lisa come up with a &quot;mangled version&quot; of ''Random Harvest'', about &quot;Lionel being shot in the head every five minutes.&quot;

Several Indian films were influenced by this film: Bengali film ''[[Harano Sur]]'' (1957), starring Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen; Tamil film [[Amara Deepam (1956 film)]] and its Hindi remake [[Amar Deep (1958 film)]] starring [[Dev Anand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Rajadhyaksha| first1=Ashish| last2=Willerman| first2=Paul| title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Cinema| publisher=Routledge| date=July 10, 2014| page=1994| isbn=978-1135943257| location=New York| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rF8ABAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Encyclopaedia+of+Indian+Cinema&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8hoiHlbLdAhUToYMKHYWeCmEQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=uttam%20kumar&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
