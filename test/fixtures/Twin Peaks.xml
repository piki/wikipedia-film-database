'''''Twin Peaks''''' is an American [[mystery fiction|mystery]] [[Horror fiction|horror]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama]] television series created by [[Mark Frost]] and [[David Lynch]] that premiered on April 8, 1990, on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. It was one of the [[Nielsen ratings|top-rated]] series of 1990, but declining ratings led to its cancellation after its second season in 1991. It nonetheless gained a [[cult following]] and has been referenced in a wide variety of media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moldovan|first1=Raluca|title='That Show You Like Might Be Coming Back in Style': How Twin Peaks Changed the Face of Contemporary Television|journal=American, British and Canadian Studies Journal|date=June 1, 2015|volume=24|issue=1|pages=44–68|doi=10.1515/abcsj-2015-0003|language=en|issn=1841-964X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Rebecca|title=Ontological Security, Authorship, and Resurrection: Exploring Twin Peaks' Social Media Afterlife|journal=Cinema Journal|date=June 3, 2016|volume=55|issue=3|pages=143–147|doi=10.1353/cj.2016.0029|issn=1527-2087}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garner|first1=Ross P.|title=&quot;The Series That Changed Television&quot;?: Twin Peaks, &quot;Classic&quot; Status, and Temporal Capital|journal=Cinema Journal|date=June 3, 2016|volume=55|issue=3|pages=137–142|doi=10.1353/cj.2016.0020|issn=1527-2087|url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/91376/1/Garner%20v1.0%20Formatted%20%28002%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ny&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/thoughts-announced-return-twin-peaks |title=Some Thoughts on the Planned Return of ''Twin Peaks'' |first=Ian |last=Crouch |date=October 7, 2014 |journal=The New Yorker |accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, ''Twin Peaks'' has often been listed among the greatest television series of all time.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvguide&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time 100&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;25 best&quot;&gt;&quot;25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years.&quot; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.

The series follows an investigation headed by [[FBI]] Special Agent [[Dale Cooper]] ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]) into the murder of [[homecoming queen]] [[Laura Palmer]] ([[Sheryl Lee]]) in the fictional suburban town of Twin Peaks, [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The show's narrative draws on elements of [[detective fiction]], but its [[uncanny]] tone, [[supernatural]] elements, and [[Camp (style)|campy]], [[melodrama]]tic portrayal of eccentric characters also draw on American [[soap opera]] and [[horror film|horror]] tropes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Connor|first1=Tom|date=December 1, 2004|title=Bourgeois Myth versus Media Poetry in Prime-time: Re-visiting Mark Frost and David Lynch's Twin Peaks|journal=Social Semiotics|volume=14|issue=3|pages=309–333|doi=10.1080/10350330408629682|issn=1035-0330}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lacey|first1=Stephen|date=June 3, 2016|title=Just Plain Odd: Some Thoughts on Performance Styles in Twin Peaks|journal=Cinema Journal|volume=55|issue=3|pages=126–131|doi=10.1353/cj.2016.0026|issn=1527-2087}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ny&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jun/10/twin-peaks-final-scene-anniversary-showtime|title=Twin Peaks' final scene: 25 years on, it's as disturbing as ever|last=Dean|first=Michelle|date=June 10, 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like much of Lynch's work, it is distinguished by [[surrealism]], offbeat [[humor]], and distinctive [[cinematography]].&lt;ref name=&quot;atl&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/01/david-lynch-influence/425094/|title=The Remarkable Influence of David Lynch|last1=Mariani|first1=Mike|date=January 23, 2016|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Music of Twin Peaks|acclaimed score]] was composed by [[Angelo Badalamenti]] in collaboration with Lynch.&lt;ref name=&quot;g&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/mar/25/twin-peaks-soundtrack|title=Twin Peaks stills marks the summit of TV soundtracks &amp;#124; Music|last=Beaumont-Thomas|first=Ben|date=March 25, 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was followed by a 1992 feature film, ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'', that serves as a prequel to the series. Following a hiatus of over 25 years, the show returned in May 2017 as a limited series on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], also known as ''[[Twin Peaks (2017 TV series)|Twin Peaks: The Return]].'' The series comprised 18 episodes written by Lynch and Frost, and was directed by Lynch. Many original cast members, including MacLachlan, returned.

===Season one===
[[File:Sheryl Lee.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright|Season one of ''Twin Peaks'' focuses on the mystery of who killed Laura Palmer (played by [[Sheryl Lee]], pictured in 1990).]]
In 1989, the logger [[Pete Martell]]  discovers a naked corpse wrapped in plastic on the bank of a river outside the town of Twin Peaks, [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. When [[Sheriff Harry S. Truman]], his deputies, and Dr. [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Will Hayward|Will Hayward]] arrive, the body is identified as [[homecoming queen]] [[Laura Palmer]]. A badly injured second girl, [[Ronette Pulaski]], is discovered in a [[fugue state]].

FBI Special Agent [[Dale Cooper]] is called in to investigate. Cooper's initial examination of Laura's body reveals a tiny typed letter &quot;R&quot; inserted under her fingernail. Cooper informs the community that Laura's death matches the signature of a killer who murdered another girl in southwestern Washington the previous year, and that evidence indicates the killer lives in Twin Peaks.

The authorities discover through Laura's diary that she has been living a [[double life]]. She was cheating on her boyfriend, football captain [[Bobby Briggs]], with biker [[James Hurley (Twin Peaks)|James Hurley]], and prostituting herself with the help of truck driver [[Leo Johnson (Twin Peaks)|Leo Johnson]] and drug dealer [[Jacques Renault]]. Laura was also addicted to cocaine, which she obtained by coercing Bobby into doing business with Jacques.

Laura's father, attorney [[Leland Palmer]], suffers a [[nervous breakdown]]. Her best friend, [[Donna Hayward]], begins a relationship with James. With the help of Laura's cousin [[Maddy Ferguson]], Donna and James discover that Laura's psychiatrist, [[Dr. Lawrence Jacoby]], was obsessed with Laura, but he is proven innocent of the murder.

Hotelier [[Ben Horne]], the richest man in Twin Peaks, plans to destroy the town's lumber mill along with its owner [[Josie Packard]], and murder his lover (Josie's sister-in-law), [[Catherine Martell]] ([[Piper Laurie]]), so that he can purchase the land at a reduced price and complete a development project, Ghostwood. Horne's sultry, troubled daughter, [[Audrey Horne|Audrey]], becomes infatuated with Cooper and spies for clues in an effort to gain his affections.

Cooper has a dream in which he is approached by a one-armed otherworldly being who calls himself MIKE. MIKE says that Laura's murderer is a similar entity, [[Killer BOB]], a feral, denim-clad man with long gray hair. Cooper finds himself decades older with Laura and [[The Man from Another Place|a dwarf in a red business suit]], who engages in coded dialogue with Cooper. The next morning, Cooper tells Truman that, if he can decipher the dream, he will know who killed Laura.

Cooper and the sheriff's department find the one-armed man from Cooper's dream, a traveling shoe salesman named Phillip Gerard. Gerard knows a Bob, the veterinarian who treats Renault's pet bird. Cooper interprets these events to mean that Renault is the murderer, and with Truman's help, tracks Renault to One-Eyed Jack's, a brothel owned by Horne across the border in Canada. He lures Jacques Renault back onto U.S. soil to arrest him, but Renault is shot while trying to escape and is hospitalized.

Leland, learning that Renault has been arrested, sneaks into the hospital and murders him. The same night, Horne orders Leo to burn down the lumber mill with Catherine trapped inside and has Leo gunned down by Hank Jennings to ensure Leo's silence. Cooper returns to his room following Jacques's arrest and is shot by a masked gunman.

===Season two===
[[File:Kyle MacLachlan.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright|After solving the murder of Laura Palmer, [[Kyle MacLachlan]]'s (pictured here in 1991) character of Dale Cooper stays in Twin Peaks to investigate further.]]
Lying hurt in his hotel room, Cooper has a vision in which a [[The Giant (Twin Peaks)|giant]] appears and reveals three clues: &quot;There is a man in a smiling bag&quot;; &quot;The owls are not what they seem&quot;; and &quot;Without chemicals, he points.&quot; He takes Cooper's gold ring and explains that when Cooper understands the three premonitions, his ring will be returned.

Leo Johnson survives his shooting but is brain-damaged. Catherine Martell disappears, presumed killed in the mill fire. Leland Palmer, whose hair has turned white overnight, returns to work but behaves erratically. Cooper deduces that the &quot;man in the smiling bag&quot; is the corpse of Jacques Renault in a body bag.

MIKE is inhabiting the body of Phillip Gerard. His personality surfaces when Gerard forgoes the use of a certain drug. MIKE reveals that he and BOB once collaborated in killing humans and that BOB is similarly inhabiting a man in the town. Cooper and the sheriff's department use MIKE, in control of Gerard's body, to help find BOB (&quot;without chemicals, he points&quot;.)

Donna befriends an [[agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] orchid grower named Harold Smith whom Laura entrusted with a second, secret diary she kept. Harold catches Donna and Maddy attempting to steal the diary from him and hangs himself in despair. Cooper and the sheriff's department take possession of Laura's secret diary, and learn that BOB, a friend of her father's, had been sexually abusing her since childhood and she used drugs to cope. They initially suspect that the killer is Ben Horne and arrest him, but Leland Palmer is revealed to viewers to be BOB's host when he brutally kills Maddy.

Cooper begins to doubt Horne's guilt, so he gathers all of his suspects in the belief that he will receive a sign to help him identify the killer. The Giant appears and confirms that Leland is BOB's host and Laura's and Maddy's killer, giving Cooper back his ring. Cooper and Truman take Leland into custody. In control of Leland's body, BOB admits to a string of murders, before forcing Leland to commit suicide. Leland, as he dies, is freed of BOB's influence and begs for forgiveness. BOB's spirit disappears into the woods in the form of an owl and the lawmen wonder if he will reappear.

Cooper is set to leave Twin Peaks when he is framed for drug trafficking by [[Jean Renault]] and is suspended from the FBI. Renault holds Cooper responsible for the death of his brothers, Jacques and Bernard. Jean Renault is killed in a shootout with police, and Cooper is cleared of all charges.

[[Windom Earle]], Cooper's former mentor and FBI partner, escapes from a mental institution and comes to Twin Peaks. Cooper had previously been having an affair with Earle's wife, Caroline, while she was under his protection as a witness to a federal crime. Earle murdered Caroline and wounded Cooper. He now engages Cooper in a twisted game of chess where Earle murders someone whenever a piece is captured.

Investigating BOB's origin and whereabouts with the help of Major Garland Briggs, Cooper learns of the existence of the White Lodge and the [[Black Lodge]], two extra-dimensional realms whose entrances are somewhere in the woods surrounding Twin Peaks.

Catherine returns to town in yellowface, having survived the mill fire, and manipulates Ben Horne into signing the Ghostwood project over to her. Andrew Packard, Josie's husband, is revealed to be still alive. Josie Packard is revealed to be the person who shot Cooper at the end of the first season. Andrew forces Josie to confront his business rival and her tormentor from Hong Kong, the sinister Thomas Eckhardt. Josie kills Eckhardt but she mysteriously dies when Truman and Cooper try to apprehend her.

Cooper falls in love with a new arrival in town, [[Annie Blackburn]]. Earle captures the brain-damaged Leo for use as a henchman and abandons his chess game with Cooper. When Annie wins the Miss Twin Peaks contest, Earle kidnaps her and takes her to the entrance to the Black Lodge, whose power he seeks to use for himself.

Through a series of clues Cooper discovers the entrance to the Black Lodge, which turns out to be the strange, red-curtained room from his dream. He is greeted by the Man From Another Place, the Giant, and Laura Palmer, who each give Cooper cryptic messages. Searching for Annie and Earle, Cooper encounters [[doppelgänger]]s of various people, including Maddy Ferguson and Leland Palmer. Cooper finds Earle, who demands Cooper's soul in exchange for Annie's life. Cooper agrees but BOB appears and takes Earle's soul for himself. BOB then turns to Cooper, who is chased through the lodge by a doppelgänger of himself.

Outside the lodge, Andrew Packard, Pete Martell and Audrey Horne are caught in an explosion at a bank vault, a trap laid by the dead Eckhardt.

Cooper and Annie reappear in the woods, both injured. Annie is taken to hospital but Cooper recovers in his room at the Great Northern Hotel. It becomes clear that the &quot;Cooper&quot; who emerged from the Lodge is in fact his doppelgänger, under BOB's control. He smashes his head into a bathroom mirror and laughs maniacally.

==Production==

===Development===
In the 1980s, [[Mark Frost]] worked for three years as a writer for the television police drama ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'', which featured a large cast and extended story lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;woodward&quot;/&gt; Following his success with ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' (1980) and ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' in 1986, [[David Lynch]] was hired by a [[Warner Bros.]] executive to direct a film about the life of [[Marilyn Monroe]], based on the best-selling book ''Goddess''. Lynch recalls being &quot;sort of interested. I loved the idea of this woman in trouble, but I didn't know if I liked it being a real story.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rodley&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Rodley |first=Chris |title=Lynch on Lynch |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |isbn=0-571-19548-2 |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch and Frost first worked together on the ''Goddess'' screenplay and although the project was dropped by Warner Bros., they became good friends. They went on to work as writer and director for ''One Saliva Bubble'', a film with [[Steve Martin]] attached to star, but it was never made either. Lynch's agent, Tony Krantz, encouraged him to do a television show. He took Lynch to Nibblers restaurant in Los Angeles and said, &quot;You should do a show about real life in America—your vision of America the same way you demonstrated it in ''Blue Velvet''.&quot; Lynch got an &quot;idea of a small-town thing&quot;, and though he and Frost were not keen on it, they decided to humor Krantz. Frost wanted to tell &quot;a sort of Dickensian story about multiple lives in a contained area that could sort of go perpetually.&quot; Originally, the show was to be titled ''North Dakota'' and set in the [[Geography of North Dakota|Plains region]] of [[North Dakota]].&lt;ref name=&quot;inside twin peaks&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://welcometotwinpeaks.com/news/inside-twin-peaks-mark-frost/ |title=Inside Twin Peaks: Mark Frost Interview Live After Episode 9 Aired In 1990 (Video) |publisher=WelcomeToTwinPeaks.com |date=October 11, 2014 |accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Frost, Krantz, and Lynch rented a screening room in [[Beverly Hills]] and screened ''[[Peyton Place (film)|Peyton Place]]'', they decided to develop the town before its inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;woodward&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Woodward |first=Richard B. |title=When ''Blue Velvet'' Meets ''Hill Street Blues'' |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 8, 1990 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/08/arts/television-when-blue-velvet-meets-hill-street-blues.html |accessdate=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;patterson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Patterson |first1=Troy| last2=Jensen |first2=Jeff |title=Our Town |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=Spring 2000 |url=http://www.twin-peaks.fr/articles/serie/ewspecial.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the lack of forests and mountains in North Dakota, the title was changed from ''North Dakota'' to ''Northwest Passage'' (the title of the pilot episode), and the location to the Pacific Northwest, specifically Washington.&lt;ref name=&quot;inside twin peaks&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;patterson&quot; /&gt; They then drew a map and decided that there would be a lumber mill in the town.&lt;ref name=&quot;woodward&quot; /&gt; Then they came up with an image of a body washing up on the shore of a lake.&lt;ref name=&quot;woodward&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chion&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Chion |first=Michel |title=David Lynch |page=100 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch remembers, &quot;We knew where everything was located and that helped us determine the prevailing atmosphere and what might happen there.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;chion&quot; /&gt; Frost remembers that he and Lynch came up with the notion of the girl next door leading a &quot;desperate double life&quot; that would end in murder.&lt;ref name=&quot;patterson&quot; /&gt; The idea was inspired, in part, by the unsolved 1908 murder of Hazel Irene Drew in Sand Lake, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/hazels-brutal-murder-was-all-but-forgotten-until-she-inspired-twin-peaks/2017/05/10/b0d064a4-31dd-11e7-8674-437ddb6e813e_story.html |title=Hazel's brutal murder was all but forgotten.

Lynch and Frost pitched the idea to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] during the [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike]]&lt;ref name=&quot;fuller&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Fuller |first=Graham |title=A Town Like Malice: Maverick Director David Lynch had made a bizarre soap opera for American television |work=[[The Independent]] |date=November 24, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a ten-minute meeting with the network's drama head, Chad Hoffman, with nothing more than this image and a concept.&lt;ref name=&quot;chion&quot; /&gt; According to the director, the mystery of who killed Laura Palmer was initially going to be in the foreground, but would recede gradually as viewers got to know the other townsfolk and the problems they were having.&lt;ref name=&quot;chion&quot; /&gt; Lynch and Frost wanted to mix a police investigation with a soap opera.&lt;ref name=&quot;chion&quot; /&gt; ABC liked the idea and asked Lynch and Frost to write a screenplay for the pilot episode.

The final showdown occurred during a bi-coastal conference call between Iger and a room full of New York executives; Iger won, and ''Twin Peaks'' was on the air.&lt;ref name=&quot;chion&quot; /&gt;

Each episode took a week to shoot and after directing the second episode, Lynch went off to complete ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]'' while Frost wrote the remaining segments.&lt;ref name=&quot;jerome2&quot; /&gt; [[Standards and Practices]] had a problem with only one scene from the first season: an extreme close-up in the pilot of Cooper's hand as he slid tweezers under Laura's fingernail and removed a tiny &quot;R&quot;.

===Casting===
[[File:Piper Laurie 1990.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright|Veteran film actress [[Piper Laurie]] (pictured here in 1990) helped cement the ''Twin Peaks'' cast.]]
''Twin Peaks'' features members of a loose ensemble of Lynch's favorite character actors, including [[Jack Nance]], [[Kyle MacLachlan]], [[Grace Zabriskie]], and [[Everett McGill]]. [[Isabella Rossellini]], who had worked with Lynch on ''Blue Velvet'' was originally cast as Giovanna Packard, but she dropped out of the production before shooting began on the pilot episode. The character was then reconceived as [[Josie Packard]], of [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] ethnicity, and the role given to actress [[Joan Chen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;secrets from another place&quot;&gt;{{cite video|date=October 30, 2007|title=Twin Peaks&amp;nbsp;– The Definitive Gold Box Edition, &quot;Secrets from Another Place&quot; featurette|medium=DVD|publisher=Paramount Home Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; It casts several veteran actors who had risen to fame in the 1950s and 1960s, including 1950s film stars [[Richard Beymer]], [[Piper Laurie]], and [[Russ Tamblyn]]. Other veteran actors included British actor [[James Booth]] (''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]''), former ''[[The Mod Squad]]'' star [[Peggy Lipton]], and [[Michael Ontkean]] who co-starred in the 1970s crime drama ''[[The Rookies]]''.  Kyle MacLachlan was cast as [[Agent Dale Cooper]]. Stage actor [[Warren Frost]], father of Mark Frost, was cast as Dr. Will Hayward.

Due to budget constraints, Lynch intended to cast a local girl from [[Seattle]], reportedly &quot;just to play a dead girl&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rodley&quot; /&gt; The local girl ended up being Sheryl Lee. Lynch stated &quot;But no one—not Mark, me, anyone—had any idea that she could act, or that she was going to be so powerful just being dead.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rodley&quot; /&gt; And then, while Lynch shot the home movie that James takes of Donna and Laura, he realized that Lee had something special. &quot;She did do another scene—the video with Donna on the picnic—and it was that scene that did it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rodley&quot; /&gt; As a result, Sheryl Lee became a semi-regular addition to the cast, appearing in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] as Laura, and portraying another, recurring character: [[Maddy Ferguson]], Laura's similar-looking cousin.

The character of Phillip Gerard's appearance in the pilot episode was originally intended to be only a &quot;kind of homage to ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]''. The only thing he was gonna do was be in this elevator and walk out,&quot; according to David Lynch.&lt;ref name=&quot;rodley&quot; /&gt; However, when Lynch wrote the &quot;Fire walk with me&quot; speech, he imagined [[Al Strobel]], who played Gerard, reciting it in the basement of the Twin Peaks hospital—a scene that appeared in the European version of the pilot episode, and surfaced later in Agent Cooper's dream sequence. Gerard's full name, Phillip Michael Gerard, is also a reference to Lieutenant Phillip Gerard, a character in ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]''.

Lynch met [[Michael J. Anderson]] in 1987. After seeing him in a short film, Lynch wanted to cast the actor in the title role in ''[[Ronnie Rocket]]'', but that project failed to get made.

Richard Beymer was cast as [[Ben Horne]] because he had known Johanna Ray, Lynch's casting director. Lynch was familiar with Beymer's work in the 1961 film ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'' and was surprised that Beymer was available for the role.&lt;ref&gt;This was also the first project to reunite Beymer and Russ Tamblyn since ''West Side Story'', in which Tamblyn played the character of Riff. &quot;Secrets from Another Place&quot;, a featurette in the ''Twin Peaks Definitive Gold Box Edition'' DVD release of October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Set dresser]] [[Frank Silva]] was cast as the mysterious &quot;Bob&quot;. Lynch himself recalls that the idea originated when he overheard Silva moving furniture around in the bedroom set, and then heard a woman warning Silva not to block himself in by moving furniture in front of the door. Lynch was struck with an image of Silva in the room. When he learned that Silva was an actor, he filmed two panning shots, one with Silva at the base of the bed, and one without; he did not yet know how he would use this material. Later that day, during the filming of Sarah Palmer having a vision, the camera operator told Lynch that the shot was ruined because &quot;Frank [Silva] was reflected in the mirror.&quot; Lynch comments, &quot;Things like this happen and make you start dreaming. And one thing leads to another, and if you let it, a whole other thing opens up.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Lynch|title=Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity|publisher=[[Tarcher]]|date=December 28, 2006|pages=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch used the panning shot of Silva in the bedroom, and the shot featuring Silva's reflection, in the closing scenes of the European version of the pilot episode. Silva's reflection in the mirror can also be glimpsed during the scene of Sarah's vision at the end of the original pilot, but it is less clear. A close-up of Silva in the bedroom later became a significant image in episodes of the TV series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.totalfilm.com/features/the-29-greatest-twin-peaks-moments/there-s-bob |title=The 29 Greatest Twin Peaks Moments |work=Total Film |first=Nathan |last=Ditum |date=March 22, 2010 |accessdate=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Music of Twin Peaks}}
{{Listen|filename=Twin Peaks Theme.ogg|title=&quot;Twin Peaks Theme&quot;|format=[[Ogg]]|description=A 30 second sample of [[Angelo Badalamenti]]'s ''Twin Peaks'' theme.}}
The score for ''Twin Peaks'' has received acclaim; ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that it &quot;still marks the summit of TV soundtracks.&quot;&lt;ref name=g/&gt; In fall 1989, composer [[Angelo Badalamenti]] and Lynch created the score for the show. In 20 minutes they produced the signature theme for the series. Badalamenti called it the &quot;Love Theme from Twin Peaks&quot;. Lynch told him, &quot;You just wrote 75% of the score. It's the mood of the whole piece. It is ''Twin Peaks''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;givens&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Givens |first=Ron |title=Creative Contrasts: Making Moody Music |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,317090,00.html |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=April 6, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; While creating the score, Lynch often described the moods or emotions he wanted the music to evoke, and Badalamenti began to play the piano. In the scenes dominated by young men, they are accompanied by music that Badalamenti called Cool Jazz. The characters' masculinity was enhanced by finger-snapping, &quot;cocktail-lounge electric piano, pulsing bass, and lightly brushed percussion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;givens&quot; /&gt; A handful of the motifs were borrowed from the [[Julee Cruise]] album ''[[Floating into the Night]]'', which was written in large part by Badalamenti and Lynch and was released in 1989. This album also serves as the soundtrack to another Lynch project, ''[[Industrial Symphony No. 1]]'', a live Cruise performance also featuring [[Michael J. Anderson]] (&quot;[[The Man from Another Place]]&quot;).

The song &quot;[[Falling (Julee Cruise song)|Falling]]&quot; (''sans'' vocals) became the theme to the show, and the songs &quot;[[Rockin' Back Inside My Heart]]&quot;, &quot;The Nightingale&quot;, &quot;The World Spins&quot;, and &quot;Into the Night&quot; (found in their full versions on the album) were all, except the latter, used as Cruise's roadhouse performances during the show's run. The lyrics for all five songs were written by Lynch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r4879|title=Floating into the Night – Julee Cruise|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second volume of the soundtrack was released on October 30, 2007, to coincide with the Definitive Gold Box DVD set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001GD3ILI/|title=Twin Peaks: Season Two Music And More|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Lynch began releasing previously unavailable tracks from the series and the film via his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://welcometotwinpeaks.com/music/new-songs-photos-davidlynch-com/|title=New Twin Peaks Songs &amp; Photos At DavidLynch.com|publisher=WelcomeToTwinPeaks.com|date=April 6, 2011|accessdate=June 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidlynch.com/ |title=David Lynch Music Company |publisher=DavidLynch.com |accessdate=June 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304011109/http://davidlynch.com/ |archivedate=March 4, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming locations===
[[File:Snoqualmie Falls in June 2008.JPG|thumb|[[Snoqualmie Falls]] in June 2008]]
[[Dale Cooper|FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper]] states, in the pilot episode, that Twin Peaks is &quot;five miles south of the Canadian border, and twelve miles west of the state line&quot;. This places it in the [[Salmo-Priest Wilderness]]. Lynch and Frost started their location search in [[Snoqualmie, Washington]], on the recommendation of a friend of Frost. They found all of the locations that they had written into the pilot episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;patterson&quot; /&gt;  The towns of Snoqualmie, [[North Bend, Washington|North Bend]] and [[Fall City, Washington|Fall City]] – which became the primary filming locations for stock ''Twin Peaks'' exterior footage – are about an hour's drive from the town of [[Roslyn, Washington]], the town used for the series ''[[Northern Exposure]]''.  Many exterior scenes were filmed in wooded areas of [[Malibu, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;secrets from another place&quot;/&gt; Most of the interior scenes were shot on standing sets in a [[San Fernando Valley]] warehouse.

The soap opera show-within-the-show ''Invitation to Love'' was not shot on a studio set, but in the [[Ennis House]], an architectural landmark designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcet.org/shows/classic_cool_theater/web-extras/a-short-history-of-the-ennis-house-in-geek-culture.html |title=A Short History of the Ennis House in Geek Culture |publisher=KCET |first=Drew |last=Mackie |date=October 29, 2012 |accessdate=October 8, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015093358/http://www.kcet.org/shows/classic_cool_theater/web-extras/a-short-history-of-the-ennis-house-in-geek-culture.html |archivedate=October 15, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Mark Frost and David Lynch made use of repeating and sometimes mysterious motifs such as trees (especially fir and pines), coffee, cherry pie, donuts, owls, logs, ducks, water, fire—and numerous embedded references to other films and TV shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ott |first=Brian L. |title=The Small Screen: How Television Equips Us to Live in the Information Age |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |year=2007 |page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the filming of the scene in which Cooper first examines Laura's body, a malfunctioning fluorescent lamp above the table flickered constantly, but Lynch decided not to replace it, since he liked the disconcerting effect that it created.&lt;ref name=&quot;secrets from another place&quot;/&gt;

Cooper's dream at the end of the third episode, which became a driving plot point in the series's first season and ultimately held the key to the identity of Laura's murderer, was never scripted. The idea came to Lynch one afternoon after touching the side of a hot car left out in the sun: &quot;I was leaning against a car—the front of me was leaning against this very warm car. My hands were on the roof and the metal was very hot. The Red Room scene leapt into my mind. 'Little Mike' was there, and he was speaking backwards... For the rest of the night I thought only about The Red Room.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rodley&quot; /&gt; The footage was originally shot along with the pilot, to be used as the conclusion were it to be released as a feature film. When the series was picked up, Lynch decided to incorporate some of the footage; in the third episode, Cooper, narrating the dream, outlines the shot footage which Lynch did not incorporate, such as Mike shooting Bob and the fact that he is 25 years older when he meets Laura Palmer's spirit.

In an attempt to avoid cancellation, the idea of a Cooper possessed by Bob came up and was included in the final episode, but the series was cancelled even before the episode was aired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/03/28/twin-peaks-revival-kyle-maclachlan/ |title=Kyle MacLachlan on suiting up as Agent Cooper again: Twin Peaks revival is a 'journey into the unknown' |work=Entertainment Weekly |first=Jeff |last=Jensen |date=March 28, 2017 |accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==

Before the one and a half hour pilot premiered on TV, a screening was held at the Museum of Broadcasting in Hollywood.&lt;ref name=&quot;roush&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roush |first=Matt |title=High Hopes for ''Twin Peaks'' |journal=[[USA Today]] |date=April 6, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media analyst and advertising executive Paul Schulman said, &quot;I don't think it has a chance of succeeding. It is not commercial, it is radically different from what we as viewers are accustomed to seeing, there's no one in the show to root for.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;roush&quot; /&gt; The show's Thursday night time slot had not been a good one for soap operas, as both ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' and its short-lived spin-off ''[[The Colbys]]'' did poorly.&lt;ref name=&quot;roush&quot; /&gt; ''Twin Peaks'' was also up against the hugely successful sitcom ''[[Cheers]]''.

Initially, the show received a positive response from TV critics. [[Tom Shales]], in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', wrote, &quot;''Twin Peaks'' disorients you in ways that small-screen productions seldom attempt. It's a pleasurable sensation, the floor dropping out and leaving one dangling.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;shale&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shale |first=Tom |title=Troubling, Transcendent ''Twin Peaks'' |journal=[[The Washington Post]] |date=April 8, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The New York Times'', John J.

The two-hour pilot was the highest-rated movie for the 1989–90 season with a 22 rating and was viewed by 33% of the audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;bickelhaupt&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bickelhaupt |first=Susan |title=''Twin Peaks'' vs. ''Cheers'' |journal=[[Boston Globe]] |date=April 12, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its first broadcast as a regular one-hour drama series, ''Twin Peaks'' scored ABC's highest ratings in four years in its 9:00 pm Thursday time slot.&lt;ref name=&quot;carter&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Carter |first=Bill |title=''Twin Peaks'' May Provide a Ratings Edge for ABC |journal=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 16, 1990 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/16/business/the-media-business-twin-peaks-may-provide-a-ratings-edge-for-abc.html?scp=36&amp;sq=%22Twin+Peaks%22&amp;st=nyt |accessdate=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show also reduced NBC's ''Cheers'''s ratings. ''Twin Peaks'' had a 16.2 rating with each point equaling 921,000 homes with TVs.&lt;ref name=&quot;carter&quot; /&gt; The episode also added new viewers because of what ABC's senior vice-president of research, Alan Wurtzel, called &quot;the water cooler syndrome&quot;, in which people talk about the series the next day at work.&lt;ref name=&quot;carter&quot; /&gt;

But the show's third episode lost 14% of the audience that had tuned in a week before.&lt;ref name=&quot;carter2&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Carter |first=Bill |title=''Twin Peaks'' Clouded By Decline in Viewers |journal=The New York Times |date=April 28, 1990 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/28/business/twin-peaks-clouded-by-decline-in-viewers.html?scp=43&amp;sq=%22Twin+Peaks%22&amp;st=nyt |accessdate=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; That audience had dropped 30% from the show's first appearance on Thursday night. This was a result of competing against ''Cheers'', which appealed to the same demographic that watched ''Twin Peaks''. A production executive from the show spoke of being frustrated with the network's scheduling of the show. &quot;The show is being banged around on Thursday night. If ABC had put it on Wednesday night it could have built on its initial success. ABC has put the show at risk.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;carter2&quot; /&gt;

In response, the network aired the first-season finale on a Wednesday night at 10:00 pm instead of its usual 9:00 pm Thursday slot.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title=''Twin Peaks'' Finale To Be on a New Night |journal=The New York Times |date=May 2, 1990 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/02/arts/twin-peaks-finale-to-be-on-a-new-night.html?|accessdate=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show achieved its best ratings since its third week on the air with a 12.6 and a 22 share of the audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;carter4&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Carter |first=Bill |title=ABC Last in &quot;Sweep&quot; Rating Despite ''Twin Peaks'' Finale |journal=The New York Times |date=May 25, 1990 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/25/arts/abc-last-in-sweep-rating-despite-twin-peaks-finale.html? |accessdate=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 22, 1990, it was announced that ''Twin Peaks'' would be renewed for a second season.&lt;ref name=&quot;carter3&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Carter |first=Bill |title=''Twin Peaks'' Is Renewed on ABC |journal=The New York Times |date=May 22, 1990 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/22/arts/twin-peaks-is-renewed-on-abc.html? |accessdate=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first and second season, the search for Laura Palmer's killer served as the engine for the plot, and captured the public's imagination, although the creators admitted this was largely a [[MacGuffin]]; each episode was really about the interactions between the townsfolk.&lt;ref name=&quot;fuller&quot; /&gt; The unique (and often bizarre) personalities of each citizen formed a web of minutiae that ran contrary to the town's quaint appearance. Adding to the surreal atmosphere was the recurrence of Dale Cooper's dreams, in which the FBI agent is given clues to Laura's murder in a supernatural realm that may or may not be of his imagination. The first season contained only eight episodes (including the two-hour pilot episode), and was considered technically and artistically revolutionary for television at the time, and geared toward reaching the standards of film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyons|first1=Siobhan|title=Between Two Worlds: Twin Peaks and the Film/Television Divide|journal=Open Library of Humanities|date=April 5, 2017|volume=3|issue=1|doi=10.16995/olh.89|issn=2056-6700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have noted that ''Twin Peaks'' began the trend of accomplished [[cinematography]] now commonplace in today's television dramas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/tv/return-to-twin-peaks-a-tv-landmark-20-years-later/ |title='Twin Peaks' revisited: 'Maybe we shouldn't have solved the mystery' |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Michael |last=Giltz |date=August 23, 2010 |accessdate=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch and Frost maintained tight control over the first season, handpicking all of the directors, including some Lynch had known from his days at the [[American Film Institute]] (e.g., [[Caleb Deschanel]] and [[Tim Hunter (director)|Tim Hunter]]) and some referred to him by those he knew personally. Lynch and Frost's control lessened in the second season, corresponding with what is generally regarded as a decrease in the show's quality once the identity of Laura Palmer's murderer was revealed.

The aforementioned &quot;water cooler effect&quot; put pressure on the show's creators to solve the mystery. Although they claimed to have known from the series' inception the identity of Laura's murderer,&lt;ref name=&quot;secrets from another place&quot;/&gt; Lynch never wanted to solve the murder, while Frost felt that they had an obligation to the audience to solve it. This created tension between the two men.&lt;ref name=&quot;patterson&quot; /&gt;

Its ambitious style, paranormal undertones, and engaging murder mystery made ''Twin Peaks'' an unexpected hit. Its characters, particularly MacLachlan's Dale Cooper, were unorthodox for a supposed crime drama, as was Cooper's method of interpreting his dreams to solve the crime. During its first season, the show's popularity reached its zenith, and elements of the program seeped into mainstream popular culture, prompting parodies, including one in [[Saturday Night Live (season 16)|the 16th-season premiere of ''Saturday Night Live'']], hosted by MacLachlan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leerhsen |first=Charles |title=The Cult of 'Twin Peaks' |journal=[[Newsweek]] |date=May 7, 1990 |url=http://www.lynchnet.com/tp/articles/newsweekmay7.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Declining ratings===
[[File:HeatherGrahamByDimitriSarantis2011.jpg|thumb|upright|As the series' ratings started to decline, the producers added [[Heather Graham]] (seen here in 2011) to the cast.]]

With the resolution of ''Twin Peaks''' main drawing point (Laura Palmer's murder) in the middle of the second season, and with subsequent story lines becoming more obscure and drawn out, public interest began to wane. This discontent, coupled with ABC changing its timeslot on a number of occasions, led to a huge drop in the show's [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] after being one of the most-watched television programs in the United States in 1990. A week after the season's 15th episode placed 85th in the ratings out of 89 shows, ABC put ''Twin Peaks'' on indefinite [[hiatus (television)|hiatus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/16/arts/twin-peaks-canceled-as-a-saturday-regular.html |title=''Twin Peaks'' Canceled As a Saturday Regular |work=The New York Times |date=February 16, 1991 |accessdate=January 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a move that usually leads to cancellation.&lt;ref name=&quot;lavery&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Full of Secrets: Critical Approaches to ''Twin Peaks'' |editor-first=David |editor-last=Lavery |publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]] |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-8143-2506-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m6mjuWXrqb8C |accessdate=January 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An organized letter-writing campaign, dubbed COOP (Citizens Opposed to the Offing of ''Peaks''), attempted to save the show from cancellation.&lt;ref name=&quot;lynchnet&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=Mark |title=Saturday Night Dead |journal=Entertainment Weekly |date=March 8, 1991 |url=http://www.lynchnet.com/tp/articles/ewmar1991.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was successful, as ABC agreed to air the remaining six episodes to finish the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;lynchnet&quot; /&gt; But due to the [[Gulf War]], ''Twin Peaks'' was moved from its usual time slot &quot;for six weeks out of eight&quot; in early 1991, according to Frost, preventing the show from maintaining audience interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWQ76qthtwE |title=TMRS: Mark Frost (Twin Peaks) Interview on WFDU (part 1 of 3) |publisher=YouTube |date=January 21, 2012 |accessdate=January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final episodes, Agent Cooper was given a love interest, [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Annie Blackburn|Annie Blackburn]] ([[Heather Graham]]), to replace the writers' intended romance between him and [[Audrey Horne]]. According to Frost, Lara Flynn Boyle, who was romantically involved with Kyle MacLachlan at the time, had effectively vetoed the Audrey-Cooper relationship, forcing the writers to come up with an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lSMjfK6hNU |title=TMRS: Mark Frost (Twin Peaks) Interview on WFDU (part 2 of 3) |publisher=YouTube |date=January 21, 2012 |accessdate=January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCz1U1VGK8o |title=TMRS: Mark Frost (Twin Peaks) Interview on WFDU (part 3 of 3) |publisher=YouTube |date=January 21, 2012 |accessdate=January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sherilyn Fenn corroborated this claim in a 2014 interview, stating, &quot;[Boyle] was mad that my character was getting more attention, so then Kyle started saying that his character shouldn't be with my character because it doesn't look good, 'cause I'm too young... I was not happy about it. It was stupid.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherilyn Fenn AV Club Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/sherilyn-fenn-talks-david-lynch-and-how-twin-peaks-200898 |title=Sherilyn Fenn talks David Lynch and how Twin Peaks should have ended |work=The A.V. Club |first=Will |last=Harris |date=January 22, 2014 |accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series finale did not sufficiently boost interest, despite ending on a deliberate audience-baiting cliffhanger, and the show was not renewed for a third season, leaving the cliffhanger unresolved.

Lynch expressed his regret at having resolved the Laura Palmer murder, saying he and Frost had never intended for the series to answer the question and that doing so &quot;killed the goose that laid the golden eggs&quot;. Lynch blamed network pressure for the decision to resolve the Palmer storyline prematurely.&lt;ref name=&quot;jensen&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Jensen |first=Jeff |title=David Lynch: Climbing the ''Peaks'' |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=October 26, 2007 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20154190,00.html |accessdate=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frost agreed, noting that people at the network had in fact wanted the killer to be revealed by the end of season one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCz1U1VGK8o |title=Mark Frost Interview on WFDU|work= Part 3 |accessdate=January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, cable channel [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]] acquired the license to rerun the entire series, which began airing in June 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR103041?refCatId=14 |title=Bravo picks up 'Peaks' |last=Klein |first=Richard |work=Variety |date=January 17, 1993 |accessdate= January 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reruns included Lynch's addition of introductions to each episode by the Log Lady and her cryptic musings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/dvds/Twin-Peaks-The-Definitive-Gold-Box-Edition-2700.html |title=Twin Peaks: The Definitive Gold Box Edition DVD Review |last=Rich |first=Katey |work=Cinema Blend |accessdate=January 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking back, Frost has admitted that he wished he and Lynch had &quot;worked out a smoother transition&quot; between storylines and that the Laura Palmer story was a &quot;tough act to follow&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferris&quot; /&gt; Regarding the second season, Frost felt that &quot;perhaps the storytelling wasn't quite as taut or as fraught with emotion&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferris&quot; /&gt;

==Influence==
Writing for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', Mike Mariani wrote that &quot;It would be tough to look at the roster of television shows any given season without finding several that owe a creative debt to ''Twin Peaks'',&quot; stating that &quot;Lynch's manipulation of the [[uncanny]], his surreal non-sequiturs, his [[black humor]], and his trademark ominous tracking shots can be felt in a variety of contemporary hit shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;atl&quot;/&gt; In 2010, the television series ''[[Psych]]'' paid tribute to the series by reuniting some of the cast in the fifth-season episode, &quot;[[Dual Spires]]&quot;. The episode's plot is an homage to the ''Twin Peaks'' pilot, where the characters of ''Psych'' investigate the death of a young girl in a small town called &quot;Dual Spires&quot;. The episode also contains several references to the original show. ''Twin Peaks'' actors that guest star in the episode are [[Sherilyn Fenn]], [[Sheryl Lee]], [[Dana Ashbrook]], [[Robyn Lively]], [[Lenny Von Dohlen]], [[Catherine E. Coulson]] and [[Ray Wise]]. Prior to the airing of the episode, a special event at the [[Paley Center for Media]] was held where the actors from both shows discussed the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eonline.com/news/213650/psych-s-delicious-tribute-to-twin-peaks-this-must-be-where-pies-go-when-they-die|title=Psych's Delicious Tribute to Twin Peaks: This Must Be Where Pies Go When They Die|publisher=E!

Reviewers and fans of four seasons of [[Veena Sud]]'s U.S. TV series, ''[[The Killing (U.S. TV series)|The Killing]]'', have noted similarities and borrowed elements from Lynch's ''Fire Walk with Me'' and ''Twin Peaks'', and compared Sud and Lynch's works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=The A.V.

On December 18, 2001, the first season (episodes 1–7, minus the pilot) of ''Twin Peaks'' was released on DVD in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] by [[Artisan Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Twin-Peaks/86 |title=Twin Peaks – Slight Delay &amp; Press Release |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com |first=Gord |last=Lacey |date=November 16, 2001 |accessdate=October 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017005922/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Twin-Peaks/86 |archivedate=October 17, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The box set featured digitally remastered video was noted for being the first TV series to have its audio track redone in [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Twin-Peaks-1st-Season/580 |title=Twin Peaks – The 1st Season Review |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com |first=Gord |last=Lacey |date=December 16, 2001 |accessdate=October 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017010024/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Twin-Peaks-1st-Season/580 |archivedate=October 17, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second season release was postponed several times, and the release was originally canceled in 2003 by Artisan due to low sales figures for the season 1 DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Twin-Peaks/815 |title=Twin Peaks – Where is Twin Peaks Season 2? |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com |first=Gord |last=Lacey |date=November 8, 2003 |accessdate=October 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017005920/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Twin-Peaks/815 |archivedate=October 17, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second season was finally released in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] on April 3, 2007, via [[Paramount Home Entertainment]]/[[CBS DVD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000M3439E |title=Twin Peaks: Season 2 |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 30, 2007, the broadcast version of the pilot finally received a legitimate U.S. release as part of the ''Twin Peaks'' &quot;Definitive Gold Box Edition&quot;. This set includes both versions of the pilot. The set also includes all episodes from both seasons, deleted scenes for both seasons, and a feature-length retrospective documentary. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the box set a &quot;B+&quot; rating and wrote, &quot;There are numerous fascinatingly frank mini-docs here, including interviews with many ''Peaks'' participants; together, they offer one of the best available portraits of how a TV hit can go off the rails&quot;. &lt;ref name=&quot;tucker2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Tucker |first=Ken |title=Twin Peaks: The Definitive Gold Box Edition |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=October 26, 2007 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20154221,00.html |accessdate=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books and audio===
{{Main|Twin Peaks books}}
During the show's second season, Pocket Books released three official tie-in books, each authored by the show's creators (or their family), which offer a wealth of backstory.

''[[The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer]]'', written by Lynch's daughter [[Jennifer Lynch]], is the diary as seen in the series and written by Laura, chronicling her thoughts from her twelfth birthday to the days leading up to her death. Frost's brother [[Scott Frost (writer)|Scott]] wrote ''The Autobiography of F.B.I. Special Agent Dale Cooper: My Life, My Tapes''. Kyle MacLachlan also recorded ''Diane: The Twin Peaks Tapes of Agent Cooper'', which combined audio tracks from various episodes of the series with newly recorded monologues.&lt;ref name=&quot;carter5&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Carter |first=Bill |title=Twin P's of ''Twin Peaks'': Production and Promotion |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 24, 1990 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/24/arts/twin-p-s-of-twin-peaks-production-and-promotion.html |accessdate=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Welcome to Twin Peaks: An Access Guide to the Town'' offers information about the history, flora, fauna, and culture of the fictitious town.

''The Secret History of Twin Peaks'', a novel by series co-creator Mark Frost, &quot;places the unexplained phenomena that unfolded in Twin Peaks in a layered, wide-ranging history, beginning with the journals of Lewis and Clark and ending with the shocking events that closed the finale.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://welcometotwinpeaks.com/news/the-secret-history-of-twin-peaks-book/ |title='&quot;The Secret History of Twin Peaks&quot; Book By Mark Frost Out October 18, 2016: Pre-Order Audio &amp; Book |publisher=Welcome to Twin Peaks |date=February 18, 2016 |accessdate=June 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published on October 18, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewrap.com/twin-peaks-book-to-reveal-tv-show-characters-fates/ |title='Twin Peaks' Book to Reveal TV Show Characters' Fates |publisher=The Wrap |first=Tim |last=Kenneally |date=October 16, 2014 |accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatrical film==
{{Main|Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me}}
The 1992 film ''Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me'' is a [[prequel]] to the TV series. It tells of the investigation into the murder of Teresa Banks and the last seven days in the life of Laura Palmer. Director [[David Lynch]] and most of the television cast returned for the film, with the notable exceptions of [[Lara Flynn Boyle]], who declined to return as Laura's best friend [[Donna Hayward]] and was replaced by [[Moira Kelly]], and Sherilyn Fenn due to scheduling conflicts. Also, [[Kyle MacLachlan]] returned reluctantly as he wanted to avoid typecasting, so his presence in the film is smaller than originally planned. Lynch originally shot about five hours of footage that was subsequently cut down to two hours and fourteen minutes. Most of the deleted scenes feature additional characters from the television series who ultimately did not appear in the finished film. Around ninety minutes of these scenes are included in the complete series Blu-ray that was released on July 29, 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;blu-ray&quot;/&gt;

''Fire Walk with Me'' was received poorly, especially in comparison to the series. It was greeted at the [[1992 Cannes Film Festival]] with booing from the audience and has received mixed reviews by American critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philipcoppens.com/twinpeaks.html|title=''Twin Peaks''|website=philipcoppens.com|authorlink=Philip Coppens (author)|first=Philip|last=Coppens|accessdate=May 9, 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120907224831/http://www.philipcoppens.com/twinpeaks.html|archivedate=September 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/twin-peaks-fire-walk-with-me/ |title=Twin Peaks – Fire Walk with Me (1992) |work=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=January 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It grossed a total of USD $1.8 million in 691 theaters in its opening weekend and went on to gross a total of $4.1 million in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =''Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me'' |work=Box Office Mojo |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=twinpeaksfirewalkwithme.htm |accessdate=April 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuation==
In 2007, artist [[Matt Haley]] and ''Twin Peaks'' producer Bob Engels began work on a [[graphic novel]] continuation of the series, to be included in the &quot;Complete Mystery&quot; DVD box set. Haley stated: &quot;Bob and I had a number of discussions about what the story would be, I was keen to use whatever notes they had for the proposed third season. I really wanted this to be a literal 'third season' of the show. Bob told me they really wanted to get away from the high school setting, so after the resolution of the Cooper/BOB-possession plot point, they would have cut to something like 'Ten Years Later', and then shown us a Twin Peaks where Cooper had quit the FBI and had become the town pharmacist, Sheriff Truman had become a recluse, etc. He also mentioned they were going to have Sheryl Lee come back, this time as a redhead, and probably have her character killed by BOB again. There were also some vague ideas about BOB and Mike being from a planet made of creamed corn, something about Truman driving Mike backwards through the portal into the Black Lodge (which I think would have been a really nice cinematic scene).&quot; Lynch vetoed the project, stating that he respected the effort but did not want to continue the story of ''Twin Peaks'' in any way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://twinpeaksarchive.blogspot.com/2007/07/exclusive-matt-haley-interview.html |title=Exclusive Matt Haley interview! |publisher=Twin Peaks Archive |date=July 2007 |accessdate=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1995 ''[[Fangoria]]'' interview, [[Billy Zane]] confirmed that his character, John Justice Wheeler, figured in the third season story, saying: &quot;They were thinking that Audrey and I would have a baby at one point, which could have been fun.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ferrante |first=Anthony C. |year=1995 |title=Calm, Ghoul and the Collector |journal=[[Fangoria]] |issue=141 |page=38 |publisher=The Brooklyn Company, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, cast member [[Ray Wise]] stated what Lynch had said to him regarding a possible continuation: &quot;Well, Ray, you know, the town is still there. And I suppose it's possible that we could revisit it. Of course, you're already dead... but we could maybe work around that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://welcometotwinpeaks.com/news/david-lynch-revisit-twin-peaks/ |title=David Lynch To Ray Wise: &quot;We Could Revisit Twin Peaks&quot; |publisher=WelcomeToTwinPeaks.com |date=May 30, 2013 |accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limited series===
{{Main|Twin Peaks (2017 TV series)}}

On October 6, 2014, it was announced that a [[Television show#Limited series|limited series]] would air on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. [[David Lynch]] and [[Mark Frost]] wrote all the episodes, and Lynch directed. Frost emphasized that the new episodes are not a remake or reboot but a continuation of the series. The episodes are set in the present day, and the passage of 25 years is an important element in the plot.&lt;ref name=&quot;revival&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/twin-peaks-revival-to-air-on-showtime-in-2016-1201322329|title=Twin Peaks Revival to Air on Showtime in 2016|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|date=October 6, 2014|work=Variety|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
