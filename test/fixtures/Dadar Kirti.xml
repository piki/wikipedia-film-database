== Plot ==
Kedar Chatujye ([[Tapas Paul]]), a dim-witted simpleton, is exiled to his uncle’s house in a small town in Bihar by his father, who is extremely angry with him for being unable to pass his B.A. exams after three attempts. The simple-minded Kedar becomes the butt of all jokes of his cousin Santu's (Ayan Banerjee) gang of friends led by Bhombol Bhattacharjee also known as  Bhombolda ([[Anup Kumar (actor)|Anup Kumar]]).

He falls in love of Saraswati ([[Mahua Roychoudhury]]), a girl with a strong, no-nonsense character who is the elder sister of Santu’s betrothed Beena ([[Debashree Roy]]), at first sight. Saraswati even falls in love of Kedar not because of Bhombal's many lies but because of his simple nature. Saraswati’s parents too are impressed by Kedar’s decency and simplicity; they soften up to Kedar. However, Bhombolda and his gang create misunderstandings between the two. A disappointed Saraswati decides to marry a rich boy from Bhagalpur ([[Kaushik Banerjee]]). At the end, Bhombolda realises that Kedar has a heart of gold and admits his wrongdoing leading Saraswati to marry Kedar.
