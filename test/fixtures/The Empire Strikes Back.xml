'''''The Empire Strikes Back''''', also known as '''''Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back''''', is a 1980 American [[Epic film|epic]] [[space opera]] film directed by [[Irvin Kershner]] and written by [[Leigh Brackett]] and [[Lawrence Kasdan]], based on a story by [[George Lucas]]. Produced by [[Lucasfilm]], it is the second film in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series (albeit the fifth chronologically) and the sequel to ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977).{{EpIV}} Set three years after the events of the first film, the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], under the leadership of [[Darth Vader]] and the [[Palpatine|Emperor]], pursues [[Luke Skywalker]] and the rest of the [[Rebel Alliance]]. While Vader relentlessly pursues Luke's friends—[[Han Solo]], [[Princess Leia]], [[Chewbacca]], and {{nowrap|[[C-3PO]]}}—Luke studies [[the Force]] under [[Jedi Master]] [[Yoda]]. The [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Mark Hamill]], [[Harrison Ford]], [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Billy Dee Williams]], [[Anthony Daniels]], [[David Prowse]], [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]], [[Peter Mayhew]], and [[Frank Oz]].

Following the success of ''Star Wars'', Lucas hired Brackett to write the sequel; after her death in 1978, he outlined the ''Star Wars'' saga as a whole and wrote next draft himself, before hiring Kasdan. Lucas chose not to direct due to his obligations at [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] and handling the financing, and passed the duty to Kershner, his former professor. Filmed from March to September 1979, ''The Empire Strikes Back'' faced a difficult production that included actor injuries, a set fire, and fines from the [[Writers Guild of America, West|Writers]] and [[Directors Guild of America|Directors]] Guilds of America. The initial budget was $18 million, but ballooned to $33 million by the time production concluded, making it one of the most expensive films ever made at the time.

''The Empire Strikes Back'' premiered at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on May 17, 1980, and was released in the United States on May 21, 1980. The film became the [[1980 in film#Worldwide gross revenue|highest-grossing film of 1980]]. Though it was met with divided reviews, it is now regarded as the best film in the ''Star Wars'' saga and one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]]. The film has grossed over $547&amp;nbsp;million worldwide from its original run and several rereleases. Adjusted for inflation, it is the second-highest-grossing sequel of all time and the [[List of highest-grossing films in Canada and the United States|thirteenth highest-grossing film of all time in North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm |title=Films adjusted for inflation |website=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=June 21, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504000735/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm|archive-date=May 4, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the film was selected for preservation in the United States' [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

''The Empire Strikes Back'' had a significant impact on filmmaking and popular culture, being regarded as a rare example of a sequel that transcends the original. The climax, &lt;!-- Do not remove per WP:SPOILER --&gt;in which Vader reveals to Luke that he is his father,&lt;!-- Do not remove per WP:SPOILER --&gt; is often cited as one of the greatest [[plot twist]]s in cinematic history. ''The Empire Strikes Back'' was followed by ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' in 1983. The two films, alongside the original ''Star Wars'', comprise the [[Star Wars Trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]].

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be between 400 and 700 words. --&gt;
Three years after the destruction of the [[Death Star]],{{efn|As depicted in the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''.}} the [[Rebel Alliance]], led by [[Princess Leia]], has set up a new base on the ice planet [[Hoth]]. The [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] fleet, led by a merciless [[Darth Vader]], hunts for the new Rebel base by dispatching [[Droid (Star Wars)|probe droids]] across the galaxy. [[Luke Skywalker]] is captured by a [[wampa]] while investigating one such probe, but manages to escape from its lair using [[the Force]] and his [[lightsaber]]. Before Luke succumbs to [[hypothermia]], the [[Force spirit]] of his deceased mentor, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], instructs him to go to the swamp planet [[Dagobah]] to train under [[Jedi Master]] [[Yoda]]. [[Han Solo]] discovers Luke and manages to keep him alive by keeping him under the body fat of his dead [[Tauntaun]] mount, and the two are rescued by a search party the following morning.

The probe alerts the Imperial fleet to the Rebels' location. The Empire launches a large-scale attack using [[AT-AT walker]]s to capture the base, which forces the Rebels to evacuate. Han and Leia escape with {{nowrap|[[C-3PO]]}} and [[Chewbacca]] on the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', but the ship's [[hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperdrive]] malfunctions. They hide in an [[Asteroid belt|asteroid field]], where Han and Leia grow closer amidst the tensions. Several bounty hunters, summoned by Vader, assist in searching for the ''Falcon''. Meanwhile, Luke travels with {{nowrap|[[R2-D2]]}} in his [[X-wing fighter]] to Dagobah, where he crash-lands. He meets a diminutive creature who reveals himself to be Yoda; who reluctantly accepts Luke as his apprentice after conferring with Obi-Wan's spirit. Luke learns more about the Force from Yoda, who lifts his X-wing out of the swamp using the Force.

After evading the Imperial fleet, Han's group travels to the floating Cloud City on the planet [[Bespin]], which is governed by Han's old friend [[Lando Calrissian]]. Bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]] tracks the ''Falcon'' and, with Vader, forces Lando to hand the group over to the Empire. Vader plans to use the group as bait to lure Luke, intending to capture him and turn him to the [[dark side of the Force]]. Luke experiences a premonition of Han and Leia in pain and, against the wishes of Yoda and Obi-Wan, abandons his training to rescue them.

Vader intends to hold Luke in [[suspended animation]] by imprisoning him in carbonite, selecting Han to be frozen as an experiment. Han survives the process and is given to Fett, who plans to collect a bounty on him from [[Jabba the Hutt]]. Lando, still loyal to Han, frees Leia and Chewbacca, but they are too late to stop Fett from departing with Solo. Under attack from [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtroopers]], they fight their way back to the ''Falcon'' and flee the city. Meanwhile, Luke arrives and engages Vader in a lightsaber duel that leads them over the city's central air shaft. Vader severs Luke's right hand, disarming him, and tempts him to embrace his anger and join the dark side. Luke accuses Vader of murdering his father, but Vader reveals that ''he'' is Luke's father. Horrified, Luke drops into the air shaft and is ejected beneath the floating city, where he hangs from an antenna. He reaches out [[Telepathy|telepathically]] to Leia, who senses him and persuades Lando and Chewie to turn back. After Luke is brought aboard, they are chased by [[TIE fighter]]s towards Vader on his [[Star Destroyer]] and find that the ''Falcon''{{'}}s hyperdrive has been tampered with, but {{nowrap|R2-D2}} reactivates it, allowing them to escape.

Luke rejoins the Rebel fleet and his severed hand is replaced with a [[Technology in Star Wars#Prosthetics|robotic prosthesis]]. Lando and Chewbacca begin their quest to save Han, as the other rebels watch the ''Falcon'' depart.

==Production==
===Development===
[[File:Irvin Kershner.jpg|thumb|upright|Lucas hired his former professor and veteran independent filmmaker [[Irvin Kershner]] to direct the movie.]]
[[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', released in May 1977, was an unexpected box office success and quickly became a [[Cultural impact of Star Wars|pop-culture phenomenon]].{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=2}} Lucas, who did not expect the success, stopped doing publicity after a while because it became too overwhelming. The success of ''Star Wars'' and its licensing opportunities meant that a sequel was inevitable.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=3}} Sequels were generally not well regarded at the time and Lucas was not ready to commit, as the production of the original film &quot;had been a four-year horrific seat-of-the-pants experience&quot;—one that Lucas never wanted to experience again.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=3}} However, the film did not represent what he had envisioned, and he knew that a sequel would allow him to finish the story. Additionally, Lucas had already established the ''Star Wars'' universe, so he figured a sequel would provide an opportunity to introduce more ideas and adventures. &quot;I always felt if I could go back to those environments using the same characters, I could make a helluva better movie,&quot; he said.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=3–4}} Lucas hired [[Alan Dean Foster]], the [[ghostwriter]] of the [[Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker|''Star Wars'' novelization]], to write the sequel novel ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'' so it could be adapted as a low-budget film if ''Star Wars'' was a box-office failure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wenz |first=John |title=The First Star Wars sequel: Inside the writing of Splinter of the Mind's Eye |url=https://syfy.com/syfywire/the-first-star-wars-sequel-inside-the-writing-of-splinter-of-the-minds-eye |work=Syfy |publisher=SyFy Channel |date=January 1, 2018 |accessdate=February 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930231749/https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/the-first-star-wars-sequel-inside-the-writing-of-splinter-of-the-minds-eye|archive-date=September 30, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by August 1977 ''Star Wars'' was still the number-one film in cinemas, motivating Lucas to continue the saga.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=7}}

Before production on the sequel, then titled ''Star Wars: Chapter II'', could begin, Lucas had to sort out various problems that had arisen. His [[special effects]] company, [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] (ILM), no longer had any employees, as many of them had left to form Apogee and work on ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]''. ''Galactica'' became a &quot;thorn in [Lucas's] side,&quot;{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=4}} as the project bore a strong resemblance to ''Star Wars'' to the point that production illustrator [[Ralph McQuarrie]] called it a &quot;rip-off.&quot;{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=6}} Lucas hired some of the ''Galactica'' crew back, but had to replace others—most notably [[John Dykstra]], whom he had a hard time working with on ''Star Wars''. Lucas had almost fired Dykstra during the production of the first film but did not because Dykstra had close friends on the crew, so Lucas also chose not to hire them back as well.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=6}} One of Lucas's new hirees was [[Brian Johnson (special effects artist)|Brian Johnson]], who had worked on ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) and turned down an opportunity to work on the first film.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=6–7}} Lucas also had to build his studio, [[Lucasfilm]], which similarly had few employees.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=5}}

Distributor [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] had tried to sell ''Star Wars'' to other studios because it feared it would lose money on the overbudget production, but following the film's success, by September 1977 it was eager to make a deal with Lucas on the sequel. Unlike the prolonged negotiations of ''Star Wars'', which took years, Lucas was able to strike a deal with Fox swiftly, partially because he planned to finance the sequel himself{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=10}} with $33 million from loans and the previous film's earning. Lucas hoped to become independent from the Hollywood film industry and went against the principles of many Hollywood producers, who believe in never investing one's own money.&lt;ref name=&quot;EOD&quot;/&gt; Similar to how he set up The Star Wars Corporation for the first film, Lucas created a subsidiary, The Chapter II Company, to help minimize the financial risks. By the end of September, the contract had been signed: the &quot;negative cost&quot; of the sequel was set at $8 million, Lucas would receive [[final cut privilege]], and Lucasfilm was guaranteed 77.5% of the profits if the film grossed over $100 million.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=10}} Under the contract, by July 1978 Lucasfilm subsidiary Black Falcon Ltd. would gain control of licensing, marketing, and merchandise, and the profit split would be 80% for Lucasfilm and 20% for Fox. The contract made it clear that Fox would have no creative control over the film, set a January 1979 start date for filming, and a May 1, 1980 release date.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=11}}

Now fully in control of the ''Star Wars'' enterprise, Lucas chose not to direct the sequel because of his other production roles, including overseeing ILM and handling the financing. Lucas offered the role of director to [[Irvin Kershner]], one of his former professors at the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Behind the Scenes: The Empire Strikes Back |work=[[American Cinematographer]] |url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/starwars/index.html |accessdate=March 2, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109131413/http://www.theasc.com/magazine/starwars/index.html|archive-date=November 9, 2006|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kershner was known for smaller character-driven films, but had more recently directed the true-life drama ''[[Raid on Entebbe (film)|Raid on Entebbe]]'' (1977) and the thriller ''[[Eyes of Laura Mars]]'' (1978). Kershner initially turned Lucas down, citing his belief that a sequel would never meet the quality or originality of ''Star Wars''. He called his agent, who immediately demanded that he take the job.&lt;ref name=&quot;EOD&quot;/&gt; In November 1977, Lucas hired science-fiction author [[Leigh Brackett]] to write the screenplay.&lt;ref name=JonesWriting/&gt;{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=15}} Lucas had only written the original ''Star Wars'' out of necessity, which had been challenging since he had to create the world. Since the ''Star Wars'' universe had been established, he chose to collaborate with Brackett and give her ideas for the script.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=15}}

Lucas began outlining the film around August 1977, introducing ideas such as the Emperor and the notion that Luke Skywalker had a long-lost sister.{{efn|Not yet established to be Leia, who is revealed to be Luke's lost sister in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983).}} Lucas also started considering ways to explain Luke actor Mark Hamill's facial scars (which he suffered in a January 1977 motorcycle crash) within the context of the ''Star Wars'' universe.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=7}} According to Hamill, Lucas told him that, had Hamill died in the accident, he would have replaced Luke with a new character.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=10}} Story conferences began on November 28, 1977, after Lucas hired Brackett.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=15}} The two held story conferences until early December, and Brackett wrote her draft while McQuarrie began to paint concept art.&lt;ref name=JonesWriting/&gt; Lucas and Brackett discussed including the planet of the [[Wookiee]]s (which had been considered for the first film), a new alien species, and two new characters—the Emperor and a gambler from Han Solo's past.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=15–19}} Lucas also decided early on that they needed to introduce a new teacher for Luke, since Obi-Wan had been killed off in the first film.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=7}}

Lucas's initial treatment, partly inspired by [[Joseph Campbell]]'s ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', contained a few key scenes that made the final film: Luke would study the Force under a Jedi master (then named Minch Yoda) before dueling Vader and ending up hanging from the bottom of a floating city, and the gambler would betray Han to Vader.&lt;ref name=JonesWriting/&gt; As Han actor Harrison Ford had not agreed to appear in a third film, the character was written out of the ending by having him go off to secure funding for the Rebellion.&lt;ref name=JonesWriting&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Brian Jay |title=George Lucas: A Life |date=2016 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York City |isbn=978-0316257442 |pp=263, 264, 267}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his discussions with Brackett, Lucas conceived the title, ''The Empire Strikes Back'', and the idea to have it follow a structure akin to his film ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973)—one main plot with three subplots. Lucas envisioned 60 scenes, a script around 100 pages, and a roughly two-hour runtime. The two laid out the film's basic plot, but also discussed expanding the character of Han—with Lucas suggesting that he met Chewbacca because he was raised by Wookiees—and Luke's lost twin sister.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=19–21}}

Brackett and Lucas came up with various ideas for subplots, including a [[love triangle]] (Lucas compared Han to [[Rhett Butler]], Leia to [[Scarlett O'Hara]], and Luke to [[Ashley Wilkes]]), the reintroduction of Obi-Wan as a ghost, an arctic world inspired by ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' (1939–1940) and ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'' (1951), further development of the Force, and the new Jedi master being an elderly, froglike alien. They also conceived new aliens, planets, and the notion that the Emperor, not Darth Vader, is the true villain.{{sfn|Rinzler|2010|p=22–23}}

Brackett's treatment, delivered on February 21, 1978, is similar to the final film, but Anakin Skywalker appears as a ghost to instruct Luke, and Vader is a separate character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sunstein 2016&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Sunstein |first=Cass |title=The world according to Star Wars |publisher=Dey Street Books |location=New York |year=2016 |isbn=9780062484246 |oclc=939911359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2020}} Lucas was disappointed with Brackett's draft, but before he could discuss it with her, learned that she was in the hospital; she died of cancer in mid-March.{{Sfn|Bouzereau|1997|p=144}} With no writer available, Lucas had to write the next draft himself. It was this draft in which Lucas first made use of the &quot;Episode&quot; numbering for the films; ''The Empire Strikes Back'' became ''Episode II''.{{Sfn|Bouzereau|1997|p=135}} His disappointment with the first draft probably made Lucas consider different directions in which to take the story.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=161}} He made use of a new plot twist: Darth Vader claims to be Luke's father. According to Lucas, he found this draft enjoyable to write, as opposed to the yearlong struggles writing the first film, and quickly wrote two more drafts,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bouzereau 1997 123&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bouzereau|1997|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; all in April 1978.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008}}

This plot twist of Vader being Luke's father had drastic effects on the series, including the audience's interpretation of the original film.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|pp=120–21}} Lucas outlined a new backstory: Anakin Skywalker had been Ben Kenobi's brilliant student, and had a child named Luke, but was swayed to the dark side by the [[Palpatine|Emperor]] (who was really a [[Sith|Sith Lord]]). Anakin battled Kenobi on the site of a volcano and was horribly wounded, but was resurrected as Darth Vader. Meanwhile, Kenobi hid Luke on [[Tatooine]] while the Republic became the Empire and Vader systematically hunted down the Jedi.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|pp=164–65}}

With this new backstory in place, Lucas decided that ''The Empire Strikes Back'' would be the second film of two trilogies, designating it ''Episode V'' by the fifth draft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bouzereau 1997 123&quot; /&gt;{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=528}} [[Lawrence Kasdan]] had just completed writing ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;hearn&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Marcus Hearn |title=The Cinema of George Lucas |publisher=Harry N. Abrams Inc |year=2005 |location=New York City |pages=122–7 |chapter=Cliffhanging |isbn=0-8109-4968-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lucas hired him to write the next drafts with input from director [[Irvin Kershner]]. Kasdan, Kershner, and producer [[Gary Kurtz]] saw the film as a more serious and adult film, helped by the new, darker storyline, and developed the series from the light adventure roots of the first film.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=178}}

===Filming===
Filming began in Norway, at the [[Hardangerjøkulen]] [[glacier]] near the town of [[Finse]], on March 5, 1979. Like the filming of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', where the production in Tunisia coincided with the area's first major rainstorm in fifty years, the weather was against the film crew. While filming in Norway, they encountered the worst winter storm in fifty years. Temperatures dropped to {{convert|−20|F|C}}, and {{convert|18|ft|m|disp=flip}} of snow fell.&lt;ref name=&quot;EOD&quot;/&gt; On one occasion, the crew were unable to exit their hotel. They achieved a shot involving Luke's exit of the Wampa cave by opening the hotel's doors and filming Mark Hamill running out into the snow while the crew remained warm inside.&lt;ref name=&quot;EOD&quot;/&gt; Mark Hamill's face was scarred in a motor accident that occurred between filming of ''Star Wars'' and ''The Empire Strikes Back''. Despite reports to the contrary, the scene in which Luke is knocked unconscious by the Wampa was not added specifically to explain this change to Hamill's face. Lucas admitted that the scene &quot;helped&quot; the situation, though he felt that Luke's time fighting in the rebellion was sufficient explanation.&lt;ref name=&quot;DVDcom&quot;&gt;''The Empire Strikes Back'' DVD commentary featuring George Lucas, Irvin Kershner, Ben Burtt, Dennis Muren and Carrie Fisher, [2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

The production moved to [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] near London on March 13,&lt;ref name=&quot;hearn&quot;/&gt; where over 60 sets were built, more than double the number used in the previous film.&lt;ref name=&quot;EOD&quot;/&gt; A fire in January on Stage 3 (during filming of [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'') forced the budget to be increased from {{Nowrap|$18.5 million}} to {{Nowrap|$22 million}}, and by July the budget increased {{Nowrap|$3 million}} more.

Filming finished September 24, 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;hearn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John Phillip |last=Peecher |title=The Making of Return of the Jedi |year=1983 |page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The script contained a scene in which Princess Leia professed her love to Han Solo, with Han replying &quot;I love you too.&quot; Harrison Ford felt the characterization was not being used effectively, and Kershner agreed. After several takes, the director told the actor to [[Ad libitum|improvise]] on the spot, and Ford changed Solo's line to &quot;I know.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EOD&quot;/&gt;

During production, great secrecy surrounded the fact that Darth Vader was Luke's father. Like the rest of the crew, Prowse—who spoke all of Vader's lines during filming—was given a false page that contained dialogue with the revelatory line being, &quot;No. Obi-Wan killed your father.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EOD&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Chris Chiarella |year=2004 |title=Mark Hamill Interview |work=Home Theater |url=http://www.hometheatermag.com/news/100104hamill/ |accessdate=February 13, 2007|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927080611/http://www.hometheatermag.com/news/100104hamill/ |archivedate=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Ross |first=Dalton |title=Secrets and Jedis |work=Entertainment Weekly |url=https://ew.com/ew/article/0,,698013,00.html |accessdate=February 16, 2007 |date=September 16, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525154055/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,698013,00.html|archive-date=May 25, 2007|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamill was informed just moments before cameras rolled on his close-up,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ross |first=Dalton |url=https://ew.com/article/2004/09/16/10-things-we-learned-star-wars-dvds |title=10 things we learned from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; DVDs |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=September 16, 2004 |accessdate=December 15, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222104727/http://ew.com/article/2004/09/16/10-things-we-learned-star-wars-dvds/|archive-date=December 22, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and did not tell anyone, including his wife; according to Hamill, Ford did not learn the truth until he watched the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcgamer&quot;&gt;{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQQPzHerrPE#t=11m52s |title=Mark Hamill on Star Citizen, Wing Commander and Star Wars |date=November 19, 2015 |work=YouTube |accessdate=December 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130062938/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQQPzHerrPE#t=11m52s|archive-date=November 30, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To preserve the dramatic opening sequences of his films, Lucas wanted the screen credits to come only at the end. While this practice has become more common over the years, this was relatively unusual at the time. The [[Writers Guild of America, West|Writers]] and [[Directors Guild of America|Directors]] guilds of America had no problem allowing it on ''Star Wars'', back in 1977, because the writer-director credit (George Lucas) matched the company name. However, when Lucas did the same thing for the sequel, it became an issue because they viewed the company credit (Lucasfilm) as displaying Lucas' name at the start of the film, while the director and writers had theirs on the end. The guilds fined him over $250,000 and attempted to pull ''Empire'' out of theaters. The DGA also attacked Kershner; to protect his director, Lucas paid all the fines to the guilds. Due to the controversy, he left the Directors and Writers guilds, and the [[Motion Picture Association]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EOD&quot;/&gt;

The initial production budget of $18 million&lt;ref name=&quot;Box Office Mojo&quot;/&gt; was 50 percent more than that of the original. After the various increases in budget, ''The Empire Strikes Back'' became one of the most expensive films of its day, costing $33 million,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;escapistmagazine.com/v2/the-empire-strikes-back-created-the-modern-film-franchise/&lt;/ref&gt; and after the bank threatened to call in his loan, Lucas was forced to approach 20th Century Fox. Lucas made a deal with the studio to secure the loan in exchange for paying the studio more money, but without the loss of his sequel and merchandising rights. After the film's box office success, unhappiness at the studio over the deal's generosity to Lucas caused studio president [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]] to quit. The departure of his longtime ally caused Lucas to take ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' to [[Paramount Pictures]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EOD&quot;/&gt;

[[File:ATATStopAnimationLandscapeStarWars.ogv|thumb|right|The Imperial AT-AT walkers at the Battle of Hoth were created using models and a new [[Stop motion|stop motion animation]] technique developed by [[Phil Tippett]] for ''The Empire Strikes Back'' called [[go motion]]. Landscape paintings by Mike Pangrazio were used as backgrounds.]]
After the release of ''Star Wars'', ILM grew from a struggling company and moved to [[Marin County, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EOD&quot;/&gt; ''The Empire Strikes Back'' provided the company with new challenges. Whereas ''Star Wars'' mostly featured space sequences, ''The Empire Strikes Back'' featured not only space [[dogfight]]s but also an ice planet battle opening sequence and elements of cities that floated among the clouds. For the battle scenes on the ice planet [[Hoth]], the initial intent was to use [[chroma key|bluescreen]] to composite the [[AT-AT|Imperial walkers]] into still-shots from the original set. Instead, an artist ([[Michael Pangrazio]]) was hired to paint landscapes, resulting in the Imperial walkers being shot using [[stop motion]] animation in front of the landscape paintings.&lt;ref name=&quot;EOD&quot;/&gt; The original designs for the AT-ATs were, according to [[Phil Tippett]], &quot;big armored vehicles with wheels&quot;. Many believe the finished design was inspired by the [[Port of Oakland]] container cranes, but Lucas denied this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Peter Hartlaub |title=Nah, dude, they weren't cranes, they were garbage trucks |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=June 27, 2008 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/06/25/DDMH11DRSK.DTL |accessdate=June 27, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930225246/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2008%2F06%2F25%2FDDMH11DRSK.DTL|archive-date=September 30, 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|The Empire Strikes Back (soundtrack)}}
The musical score of ''The Empire Strikes Back'' was composed and conducted by [[John Williams]], and it was performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] at a cost of about $250,000.{{Sfn|Arnold|1980|p=266}} In 1980, the company [[RSO Records]] published this film's original musical score as both a double [[LP record|LP album]] and as an [[8-track tape|8-track cartridge]] in the United States. Its front cover artwork features the mask of Darth Vader against a backdrop of [[outer space]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Original Soundtrack from the Film The Empire Strikes Back |work=Star Wars Collectors Archive |url=http://www.toysrgus.com/index.php?action=disp_item&amp;item_id=38253 |accessdate=October 26, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110233838/http://www.toysrgus.com/index.php?action=disp_item&amp;item_id=38253|archive-date=November 10, 2006|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; as seen on the advance theatrical poster for the film.

In 1985, the first compact disc (CD) issue of the film score was made by the company [[Polydor Records]], which had absorbed both RSO Records and its music catalog. Polydor Records used a shorter, one compact-disc edition of the music as their master. In 1993, 20th Century Fox Film Scores released a special boxed set of four compact discs: the ''Star Wars Trilogy: The Original Soundtrack Anthology''. This anthology included the film scores of all three members of the original ''Star Wars Trilogy'' in separate CDs, even though there was significant overlap between the three (such as the ''Star Wars'' theme music).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Star Wars Trilogy: The Original Soundtrack Anthology [BOX SET] [SOUNDTRACK] |work=Amazon.com |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002VI7 |accessdate=January 20, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629195842/http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002VI7|archive-date=June 29, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the record company [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] released a definitive two-CD set to accompany the publications of all three of the Special Editions of the films of the ''Star Wars Trilogy''. This original limited-edition set of CDs featured a 32-page black booklet that was enclosed within a protective outer slip-case. The covers of the booklet and of the slip-case have selections from the poster art of the ''Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition''. All of the tracks have been digitally re-mastered supposedly for superior clarity of sound.

RCA Victor next re-packaged the Special Edition set later on in 1997, offering it in slim-line jewel case packaging as an unlimited edition, but without the packaging that the original &quot;black booklet&quot; version offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Empire Strikes Back: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (Special Edition) SOUNDTRACK |work=Amazon.com |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000003G8Z/ |accessdate=January 20, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629195904/http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000003G8Z/|archive-date=June 29, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the [[Sony Classical Records]] company purchased the sales rights of the original trilogy's musical scores—primarily because it already had the sales rights of the music from the trilogy of prequels: ''The Phantom Menace'', ''Attack of the Clones'', and ''Revenge of the Sith''. Hence in 2004, the Sony Classical company began manufacturing copies of the film-score CDs that RCA Victor had been making since 1997, including the one for ''The Empire Strikes Back''. This set was made with new cover artwork similar to that of the film's first publication on DVD. Despite the digital re-mastering by Sony Classical, their CD version made and sold since 2004 is essentially the same as the version by RCA Victor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Star Wars / The Empire Strikes Back / Return of the Jedi (Original Soundtracks – 2004 reissue) |url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/film/2004/Sep04/star_wars.html |accessdate=January 20, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127164125/http://www.musicweb-international.com/film/2004/Sep04/star_wars.html|archive-date=November 27, 2006|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==

The world premiere of ''The Empire Strikes Back'' was held on May 17, 1980, at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] in Washington, D.C. (as a special Children's World Premiere event). The film had a [[Royal Film Performance|Royal Charity Premiere]] in London at the [[Odeon Leicester Square|Odeon Cinema]] in [[Leicester Square]] on May 20. The special event was dubbed &quot;Empire Day&quot;, a playful take the British [[Commonwealth Day]] holiday (known as Empire Day prior to 1958), where legions of stormtroopers were unleashed across the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/news/an-empire-day-to-remember |title=An 'Empire Day' to Remember {{!}} StarWars.com|website=StarWars.com|language=en-US|access-date=March 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408043710/http://www.starwars.com/news/an-empire-day-to-remember|archive-date=April 8, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of other charity benefit premieres were held in numerous locations on May 19 and 20.

===Thematic analysis===
{{See also|Star Wars sources and analogues}}
Like its predecessor, ''The Empire Strikes Back'' draws from several mythological stories and world religions. It also includes many elements from 1930s [[Serial film|film serial]]s such as a childhood favorite of Lucas', ''[[Flash Gordon]]'', which similarly featured a city afloat in the sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Star Wars Origins |title=Star Wars Origins – Flash Gordon |url=http://www.jitterbug.com/origins/flash.html |accessdate=November 16, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901065433/http://www.jitterbug.com/origins/flash.html |archivedate=September 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=The 80s Movies Rewind |title=Flash Gordon (1980) |url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/ |accessdate=February 13, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209193657/http://www.fast-rewind.com/|archive-date=February 9, 2007|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Edition and other changes===
[[File:The Empire Strikes Back Special Edition.jpg|upright|thumb|The 1997 theatrical release poster of the new ''Special Edition'' version of the film (art by [[Drew Struzan]])]]
As part of ''Star Wars''{{'}}s 20th anniversary celebration in 1997, ''The Empire Strikes Back'' was digitally remastered and re-released along with ''Star Wars'' and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' under the title ''Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition''. Lucas took this opportunity to make several minor changes to the film. These included explicitly showing the [[Wampa]] creature on Hoth in full form, creating a more complex flight path for the ''Falcon'' as it approaches Cloud City, digitally replacing some of the interior walls of Cloud City with vistas of Bespin, and replacing certain lines of dialogue. A short sequence was also added depicting Vader's return to his [[Super Star Destroyer]] after dueling with Luke, created from alternate angles of a scene from ''Return of the Jedi''. Most of the changes were small and esthetic. Some fans believe that the changes to the film were less detrimental than that of the other two entries in the trilogy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Changes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |work=dvdactive |title=Star Wars: The Changes |url=http://www.dvdactive.com/editorial/articles/star-wars-the-changes-part-two |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729214213/http://www.dvdactive.com/editorial/articles/star-wars-the-changes-part-two |archivedate=July 29, 2012 |accessdate=March 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Empire Strikes Back'' was released on [[DVD]] in September 2004, bundled in a box set with ''A New Hope'', ''Return of the Jedi'', and a bonus disc of extra features. The films were digitally restored and remastered, with [[Changes in Star Wars re-releases|additional changes]] made by George Lucas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Changes&quot;/&gt; The bonus features include a commentary by George Lucas, Irvin Kershner, Ben Burtt, Dennis Muren, and Carrie Fisher, as well as an extensive documentary called ''[[Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy]]''. Also included are featurettes, teasers, trailers, TV spots, still galleries, video game demos, and a preview of ''[[Revenge of the Sith]]''. For the DVD release, Lucas and his team made changes that they stated would ensure continuity between ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and the then-recently released [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel trilogy]] films. The most noticeable of these changes was replacing the stand-in used in the holographic image of the Emperor (with Clive Revill providing the voice) with actor [[Ian McDiarmid]] providing some slightly altered dialogue. With this release, Lucas also supervised the creation of a high-definition digital print of ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and the original trilogy's other films. It was reissued in December 2005 as part of a three-disc &quot;limited edition&quot; boxed set that did not feature the bonus disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Star Wars Trilogy (Widescreen Edition Without Bonus Disc, 1977) |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BKJ78U/ |accessdate=February 19, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629195817/http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BKJ78U/|archive-date=June 29, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was reissued again on a separate two-disc Limited Edition DVD for a brief time from September 12, 2006, to December 31, 2006, this time with the film's original, unaltered version as bonus material. It was also re-released in a trilogy box set on November 4, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/movies/saga/20080826news.html |title=Star Wars Saga Repacked in Trilogy Sets on DVD |accessdate=November 8, 2008 |work=Lucasfilm |publisher=StarWars.com |date=August 28, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026032957/http://www.starwars.com/movies/saga/20080826news.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was controversy surrounding the initial release, because the DVDs featured non-anamorphic versions of the original films based on LaserDisc releases from 1993 (as opposed to newly remastered, film-based, high-definition transfers).

A [[Star Wars (radio)|radio play adaptation of ''The Empire Strikes Back'']] was written by [[Brian Daley]], and was produced for and broadcast on the [[NPR|National Public Radio]] network in the U.S. during 1983.

Writing for [[Empire Magazine]], Ian Nathan gave the film a five-star rating proclaiming &quot;it's generally agreed that The Empire Strikes Back is the best film of George Lucas' initial trilogy (despite a latter-day shift toward the original's storytelling purity). Not a sequel as such, but the next part of a continuing story, Empire marks enormous progression both in terms of the mythos of the series and in the filmmaking quality itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/star-wars-episode-v-empire-strikes-back/review/ |author=Nathan, Ian |title=Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes back Review |publisher=[[Empire Magazine]]|access-date=April 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406092716/https://www.empireonline.com/movies/star-wars-episode-v-empire-strikes-back/review/|archive-date=April 6, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the magazine's readers voted for the film as the greatest movie ever made, based on 250,000 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/empire-strikes-back-voted-greatest-movie-ever-2014-6?IR=T |author=Orange, Allen (for [[MovieWeb]]) |date=June 2, 2014 |title=250,000 Movies Fans Voted 'The Empire Strikes Back' The Greatest Movie Of All Time |website=[[Business Insider]]|access-date=April 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chuck Klosterman]] suggested that while &quot;movies like ''[[Easy Rider]]'' and ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' painted living portraits for generations they represented in the present tense, ''The Empire Strikes Back'' might be the only example of a movie that set the social aesthetic for a generation coming in the future.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Klosterman |first=Chuck |title=Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto |publisher=Scribner |date=June 22, 2004 |page=[https://archive.org/details/sexdrugscocoapuf00chuc/page/150 150] |isbn=978-0-7432-3601-0 |title-link=Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto }}&lt;/ref&gt;
