==Plot==
===The Ballad of Buster Scruggs===
Buster Scruggs, a cheerful outlaw, arrives at an isolated bar full of other outlaws where he exchanges insults with another patron before effortlessly shooting everyone as they reach for their guns. He then heads to town and enters a saloon, leaving his guns at the door to comply with its no firearms policy. He joins a game of poker that a player has suddenly left, but discovers the player vacated the seat after being dealt the infamous [[dead man's hand]], which the other players insist Buster play now that he has seen the cards. When Buster refuses, a large menacing player named Joe stands and draws a concealed pistol.  After failing to persuade Joe to end the confrontation, Buster repeatedly kicks a plank in the poker table, which tips Joe's gun hand so that his pistol points backwards and discharges into his face. Having shot himself three times, Joe falls dead.  

Buster breaks into a boisterous song (loosely based upon &quot;[[Little Joe the Wrangler]]&quot;) about &quot;Surly Joe,&quot;{{efn|The character's name as listed in the film credits is &quot;Çurly Joe&quot; with a [[cedilla]] under the first letter. In Buster's song, the name shown in the subtitles is spelled &quot;Surly Joe&quot;.|name=&quot;Joe&quot;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7TK2Ro2bdM|title=The Ballad Of Buster Scruggs – &quot;Surly Joe&quot; Tim Blake Nelson (video)|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; much to the patrons' delight. Joe's brother arrives in dismay and challenges Buster to a gunfight in the street. Buster gladly obliges and proceeds to shoot off each of the fingers of his right hand before finishing him off with the sixth shot. 

A polite young man clad in black then rides into town and challenges Buster. Buster again happily obliges, but much to his surprise, the young man is an even faster draw and shoots him through his forehead. Buster examines the wound in disbelief before collapsing, admitting via [[voice-over]] that he should have foreseen that &quot;you can't be top dog forever.&quot; The young man and Buster then sing a bittersweet duet as Buster's spirit rises from his body and floats towards heaven, complete with angel wings and a [[lyre]], and expressing hope of a place above where people are better than they are on Earth.

===Near Algodones===
A young cowboy robs an isolated bank on the prairie. As he is fleeing the jabbering bank teller shoots at him, forcing him to take cover behind a well.  He returns fire, but the teller charges him while wearing a washboard and several pots and pans as armor, which deflect all the cowboy's bullets as the teller repeatedly cackles &quot;Pan shot!&quot; The teller knocks the cowboy out with his rifle butt, and when the cowboy regains consciousness, he is sitting upon his horse under a tree with his hands tied and a noose around his neck. The lawman and posse who captured him ask for his final words, since they &quot;convicted&quot; him and sentenced him to death while he was semi-conscious. The execution is interrupted by ambushing [[Comanche]] warriors who quickly slaughter the lawman and posse but leave the cowboy in place upon the horse. After a time, a [[Droving|drover]] happens by and frees the cowboy, who then joins him on his drive. However, the drover is actually a [[cattle raiding|rustler]], and they are promptly chased down by another lawman's posse. The posse captures the cowboy and takes him into town, where the sheriff summarily orders him to hang. As the cowboy stands upon the [[gallows]] with three other men awaiting execution, he spots a beautiful young woman in the crowd and mutters, &quot;There's a pretty girl,&quot; before the hangman abruptly hoods him and pulls the [[Trapdoor#Gallows|trapdoor]] lever to cheers and applause.

===Meal Ticket===
An aging [[impresario]] and his artist Harrison, a young man with no arms or legs, travel from town to town in a wagon that converts into a small stage where Harrison theatrically recites classics such as [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]'s poem &quot;[[Ozymandias]]&quot;; the biblical story of [[Cain and Abel]]; works by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], in particular [[Sonnet 29]]; and Abraham Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]]. 

The impresario collects money from the audience at the end of each performance, with profits dwindling as they visit increasingly remote mountain towns with smaller and more indifferent audiences. Following a performance that yields no profit, the impresario observes a man nearby drawing a crowd with a chicken that can ostensibly perform basic math by pecking at painted numbers to answer addition and subtraction equations that the audience calls out. After buying the chicken, the impresario drives the wagon through a mountain pass and stops by a bridge over a rushing river. He walks to the center of the bridge and drops a large stone to gauge the water's depth before returning to the wagon wearing a faint smile. In the final scene, the impresario has resumed driving the wagon, with the caged chicken as his only passenger.

===All Gold Canyon===
A grizzled [[Gold prospecting|prospector]] arrives in a pristine mountain valley and decides to dig for gold in a grassy meadow beside a river. Over the course of several days, he [[gold panning|pans]] through shovelfuls to count the gold specks, and then begins digging a deeper hole once he's identified the location of their likely source. After his first night camping at the site, he spots a [[great horned owl]] tending its treetop nest at the edge of the valley. When he climbs up and reaches the nest, the mother owl's watchful gaze from a nearby tree causes him to replace three of the four eggs he had taken for his meal. 

On his third day, he digs out [[Gold nugget|gold nuggets]] of increasing size before finally reaching &quot;Mr. Pocket&quot;, a large [[Vein (geology)#Gold-bearing veins|gold vein]] running through the [[quartz]] he's uncovered. But no sooner does he make his discovery than a shadow falls over him; a young man who has been trailing the prospector and letting him do all the work has sneaked to the edge of the hole. He shoots the prospector in the back and the prospector falls face down.  When the young man jumps into the hole to steal the gold, the prospector stops playing dead, wrestles the young man's gun away, and kills him with it. The prospector then cleans and assesses his wound in the stream, confirming it's not lethal. He finishes mining the gold, pushes the young man's body back into the hole to serve as his grave, and departs the valley.

===The Gal Who Got Rattled===
Alice Longabaugh and her older brother Gilbert, an inept businessman, are journeying in a [[wagon train]] across the prairie towards Oregon, where Gilbert claims a new business partner will marry his sister. Gilbert dies of [[cholera]] shortly after they embark, and the wagon train's leaders, Mr. Billy Knapp and Mr. Arthur, help Alice bury her brother. Though she has no definite prospects in Oregon, Alice decides to continue the trip rather than return east. Matt, the young man Gilbert hired to lead their wagon, claims that Gilbert promised him $400, half of which he expects when they reach the halfway point at [[Fort Laramie National Historic Site|Fort Laramie]], otherwise he'll return home. Fearing Gilbert's money was buried with him, Alice conveys her predicament to Billy, who offers his support in contemplating how to proceed. He also does Alice the favor of first attempting to shoot Gilbert's small dog, President Pierce (named after [[Franklin Pierce]]), then scaring him off, because the dog's constant barking has drawn widespread complaint.

Through the course of their conversations, Billy grows fond of Alice, and proposes to solve her dilemma by marrying her in Fort Laramie, assuming Gilbert's debt to Matt, and retiring from leading wagon trains to build a home and family with her upon 640 acres in Oregon which he can claim according to the [[Donation Land Claim Act|Homestead Act]]. Alice is surprised by Billy's proposal, but she has grown fond of him, so she accepts.  Billy then informs Mr. Arthur that this will be their last ride together. 

The following morning, Mr. Arthur notices Alice missing, and rides over the hills to find her reunited with President Pierce and laughing as the dog barks at the antics of some prairie dogs. Mr. Arthur then spots an Indian sentinel and advancing war party, and gives Alice a pistol so that if he is killed, she can shoot herself and avoid capture. Mr. Arthur twice drives back the charging warriors with his rifle, but a remaining warrior momentarily appears to kill him.  He kills the Indian, then realizes that when he appeared to have died, Alice shot herself as he had instructed.  Mr. Arthur sadly walks back to the wagon train with President Pierce, unsure of what to say to Billy Knapp.

===The Mortal Remains===
At sunset, five people, an Englishman (Thigpen), an Irishman (Clarence), a Frenchman (René), a lady (Mrs. Betjeman), and a fur trapper ride to Fort Morgan, Colorado in a stagecoach. Thigpen says that he and Clarence often travel this route &quot;ferrying cargo&quot;, alluding to a corpse on the roof, but he does not specify the nature of their business. 

The Trapper rambles about his past relationship with a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native]] woman in which neither knew the other's language, but communicating through understanding each other's emotions led him to conclude that people are all alike in their basic needs, just like the animals he traps. Mrs. Betjeman, a devout Christian, indignantly rebuts that there are two kinds of people, upright and sinning, and explains that she knows this because her husband, whom she's traveling to meet after having been apart for three years, is a retired [[Chautauqua]] lecturer on &quot;moral and spiritual hygiene.&quot; René challenges her dichotomy and the trapper's oversimplification with reflections on the unique and subjective nature of human experiences. As an example, René questions whether Mr. Betjeman conceives of love the same way Mrs. Betjeman does, conjecturing that if he doesn't, perhaps he has not remained faithful to her during their separation. 

Mrs. Betjamen becomes apoplectic, and René calls out the window for the coachman to stop, but the driver doesn't halt. Thigpen explains that it is the driver's policy not to stop for any reason. Clarence sings the bittersweet folk song &quot;[[The Unfortunate Lad]]&quot;, which calms Mrs. Betjamen. He and Thigpen then reveal themselves to be &quot;reapers&quot; or [[bounty hunters]]. Thigpen tells the group that their usual method is for him to distract a target with stories while Clarence &quot;thumps&quot; them. Thigpen remarks that he enjoys watching their prey die, especially the expression in their eyes as they &quot;negotiate the passage&quot; and &quot;try to make sense of it.&quot; 

The other three are visibly unsettled by this as they arrive at the foreboding hotel in Fort Morgan where they will all be staying. They remain in the stagecoach while Thigpen and Clarence carry the corpse into the hotel, then slowly dismount and warily make their own way inside.

''The Ballad of Buster Scruggs'' was the Coens' first film to be shot [[Digital cinematography|digitally]].

Joel Coen said the shoot was physically demanding: exterior shots with uncovered sets, &quot;really brutal weather&quot; and much travel over wide-ranging locations. &quot;It wouldn’t have hurt if we were younger.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The long wagon train in &quot;The Gal Who Got Rattled&quot; proved especially challenging because of the difficulty of coordinating the oxen teams for timing and direction.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{cite podcast|url=https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/the-coen-brothers-come-to-netflix-in-the-new-western-anthology-the-ballad-of-buster-scruggs|title=Filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen On Singing Cowboys And Working With Oxen|time=15:20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen wagons were built from scratch in a New Mexico blacksmith shop then shipped in pairs on flatbed trailers to the shooting location in Nebraska. Their design was influenced by the 1930 film ''[[The Big Trail]].'' Most of the costumes were handmade for the production. Designer [[Mary Zophres]] credited [[historical reenactment]] supply companies for carrying hard-to-find period fabrics, noting that U.S. wool production was &quot;practically nil.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

=== Funding and distribution ===
From the outset, the Coens ruled out traditional film studio funding, seeing an industry shift in how smaller projects are financed. Joel Coen said that Netflix was investing in movies that aren’t based on [[Marvel Comics]] or other established [[Action film|action]] franchises, &quot;which is pretty much the business of the studios now.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The filmmakers had mixed feelings regarding distribution as ''The Ballad of Buster Scruggs'' had only a limited theatrical run before its Netflix streaming debut. The Coens credited home videos with helping establish their own careers and admitted that they succumbed to the temptation to watch movie [[Screener (promotional)|screeners]] at home rather than going out to a theater. But the &quot;hours and days and years you spend struggling over details&quot; of a film &quot;is appreciated in a different way on a big screen,&quot; Joel Coen said.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

Netflix funding was also the reason composer [[Carter Burwell]] conducted his score, with up to 40 musicians, at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London, which, he noted, is ironic given that the film is an American Western. &quot;In this case, Netflix as a distributor is not a signatory to any of the union agreements here. So they wanted to go to London so they wouldn't be involved in that. I mention that because more and more films are being made by companies that aren't signatories.&quot; He said that the issue has festered over the past 20 years to the point where the film score recording business has disappeared from New York with no prospect of being rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/carter-burwell-talks-buster-scruggs-behind-screen-podcast-1161545|title=Composer Carter Burwell Is the Latest Guest on The Hollywood Reporter's 'Behind the Screen' Podcast Series|last=Giardina|first=Carolyn|date=November 16, 2017|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Box office===
Although Netflix does not disclose box office results, IndieWire tracked reserved online seating sales and deduced ''The Ballad of Buster Scruggs'' made $6,600 on its first day from its Los Angeles and New York City locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/11/the-ballad-of-buster-scruggs-coen-brothers-characters-1202009900/|title=‘The Ballad of Buster Scruggs’: Grosses Reflect Smaller Theaters and Netflix Priorities|author=Tom Brueggemann|work = [[IndieWire]]|date=November 9, 2018 |access-date = November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then estimated the film made about $36,000 in its opening weekend (a four-day total of around $45,000). Had the results been made official, the debut per-venue estimates of $12,000 would have ranked as the lowest of the Coen Brothers' career. IndieWire estimated that the opening exceeded most Netflix releases and noted that, for the distributor, &quot;getting people to see their films in theaters is not the point.&quot;&lt;ref name=IndieWire&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/11/netflix-the-ballad-of-buster-scruggs-box-office-coen-brothers-1202019258/|title=Netflix’s Strange ‘The Ballad of Buster Scruggs’ Results; Jason Reitman’s ‘The Front Runner’ Flops|author=Tom Brueggemann|work = [[IndieWire]]|date=November 11, 2018 |access-date = November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
