I got a shock when I saw two hand-pumps inside water. I heard from people between 60-70 age group that those hand-pumps were earlier located in the middle of the village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/kadvi-hawa-director-wants-people-to-be-conscious-about-environment/story-HEdnpJbVT6K0reVpGAA0TN.html |title=Kadvi Hawa director wants people to be conscious about environment | date=10 August 2017 | newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]] | agency=Indo Asian News Service | accessdate=3 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;|author=[[Nila Madhab Panda]] on the idea behind ''Kadvi Hawa''.}}

Sweta Kausal of [[Hindustan Times]] gave the film a rating of 4 out of 5 saying that, &quot;This haunting tale of farmer suicides will give you goosebumps&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/movie-reviews/kadvi-hawa-movie-review-the-dark-haunting-tale-of-climate-change-farmers-suicide/story-17Q4uzdkfgPH1MufX7KPaL.html |title=Kadvi Hawa movie review: This haunting tale of farmer suicides will give you goosebumps |publisher=[[Hindustan Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reza Noorani of [[The Times of India]] gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5 and said that, &quot;With powerful dialogues by Nitin Dixit and achingly beautiful lyrics by Mukta Bhatt, the film is an engrossing watch. For a serious film on global warming, Kadvi Hawa is non-preachy and entirely watchable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/movie-reviews/kadvi-hawa/movie-review/61740617.cms |title=Kadvi Hawa Movie Review |publisher=[[The Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saibal Chatterjee of [[NDTV]] praised the acting performances of [[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]] and [[Ranvir Shorey]] and the direction of [[Nila Madhab Panda]]. The critic gave the film a rating of 3.5 out of 5 and said that, Kadvi Hawa &quot;is designed to provoke contemplation and action, a mission that it achieves without any serious slips. Watch it because it is an important film that offers an essential takeaway.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/kadvi-hawa-movie-review-ranvir-shorey-matches-incredibly-impactful-sanjay-mishra-1779050 |title=Kadvi Hawa Movie Review: Ranvir Shorey Matches Incredibly Impactful Sanjay Mishra |publisher=[[NDTV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shubhra Gupta of [[The Indian Express]] gave the film a rating of 2.5 out of 5 and said that, &quot;The Sanjai Mishra starrer feels like a stretch even at 100 minutes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/kadvi-hawa-movie-review-sanjai-mishra-ranvir-shorey-star-rating-4952511/ |title=Kadvi Hawa movie review: The Sanjai Mishra starrer feels like a stretch even at 100 minutes |publisher=[[The Indian Express]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Namrata Joshi]] of ''[[The Hindu]]'' felt that the movie was &quot;too slow&quot; and that its impact would have been much more with a tighter screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kadvi-hawa-review-the-killing-fields/article20746726.ece |title=Kadvi Hawa review: the killing fields |publisher=[[The Hindu]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sreehari Nair of [[Rediff]]gave the film a rating of 4 out of 5 and said that, &quot;This is an intensely felt, beautifully expressed, piece of cinema.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/review/review-rage-turns-into-beauty-in-kadvi-hawa/20171124.htm |title=Review: Rage turns into beauty in Kadvi Hawa |publisher=[[Rediff]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kriti Tulsiani of [[News18]] praised the performances of Sanjay Mishra and Ranvir Shorey saying that, &quot;Both Mishra and Shorey are in top form in their respective roles&quot; and gave the film a rating of 3.5 out of 5. The Critic concluded her review by saying that, &quot;The best part of the film perhaps is that it doesn't intend to answer or preach on the difference between right and wrong but instead leaves you with plenty to think about. Unsettling but rightly so.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/movies/kadvi-hawa-review-a-compelling-portrait-of-the-human-cost-of-climate-change-1586531.html |title=Kadvi Hawa Review: A Compelling Portrait Of the Human Cost of Climate Change |publisher=[[News18]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Financial Express (India)|Financial Express]]'' gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5 saying that, &quot;The film is good in parts but could have been much better with a tighter and fast-paced narration. But overall it is worth watching as the content is top grade and the topic hot.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.financialexpress.com/entertainment/kadvi-hawa-movie-review-sanjai-mishra-ranvir-shorey-starrer-is-a-sad-tale-of-climate-change/946196/ |title=Kadvi Hawa movie review: Sanjai Mishra, Ranvir Shorey starrer is a sad tale of climate change |publisher=[[The Financial Express (India)|Financial Express]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
