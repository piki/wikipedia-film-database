==Synopsis==
Espionage threatens the security of American Computer Technology and a skirt-chasing private investigator is assigned by federal intelligence agencies to root out the spies among the rich, oversexed socialites unknowingly supporting them.

==Plot summary==
A wealthy playboy/private-investigator named Cody Abilene is hired by a government intelligence operative to investigate a lead into who is selling computer technology to the Russians. While investigating rich socialites, amorous naked vixens, an ex-con with a penchant for blackmail, and keeping it all from his sexy lady cop friend Beverly Mcafee, Cody puts himself in the crosshairs of  the traitorous tech-spies who will gladly kill to stay in business.
The scope of the conspiracy is revealed after Cody and Beverly make love at a suspect's beachhouse, only to find a pair of hitmen gunning for them as they get dressed. Gunplay, car chases, and races ensue.&lt;!-- For Cody Abilene and the fabulous femmes surrounding him, all is not what it seems in the shadowy world of counter-espionage!--&gt;&lt;!-- no breathless prose or copying from the box unless quoted.--&gt;

==Releases==
The film was first released in March 1985, then on DVD in 2002. It then appeared in two DVD collections, ''Andy Sidaris Collection, Vol. 1'' (of six discs) in 2003, and ''Triple B Collection, Vol. 1'' in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Malibu Express DVD releases |publisher=All Movie Guide| work=allmovie.com |url=http://www.allmovie.com/dvd/releases/malibu-express-31022 |accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connections to other films==
The material from the film was reworked from a previous Sidaris film, ''[[Stacey (film)|Stacey]]'' (1973). The role of Stacey Hanson ([[Anne Randall]]) was divided into two new characters: private detective protagonist Cody Abilene ([[Darby Hinton]]) and his girlfriend June Khnockers ([[List of Playboy Playmates of 1982#July|Lynda Wiesmeier]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Coffman&quot;&gt;Coffman (2012), p. 23-26&lt;/ref&gt;

The openings of both films depict their respective female race car drivers in the finish of a practice race. Both films then have them getting out of uniform.  Stacey is the protagonist, though, while June serves mostly as the source of a recurring joke in her film: &quot;Knockers with an &quot;h&quot;?&quot;. June can still reliably drive a high-performance race car, but Cody performs most of Stacey's functions in the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coffman&quot;&gt;Coffman (2012), p. 23-26&lt;/ref&gt;

The discreet homosexual nephew John (John Alderman) turns into Stuart (Michael A. Anderson), a [[drag queen]], in the second film. In both films, the detective follows the character into a [[gay bar]]. The difference is that in the first film, John wears regular clothes, while in the second, Stuart is in full drag. Cody laughs while dictating notes in a recorder, but still admits that Stuart has great legs. Stuart is more of a cartoonish gay stereotype than John.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coffman&quot;&gt;Coffman (2012), p. 23-26&lt;/ref&gt;

The youthful niece Pamela ([[Cristina Raines]]) turns into the bit older niece Liza ([[List of Playboy Playmates of 1981#April|Lorraine Michaels]]) in the second film. Liza has her own sex scene with the houseboy Shane (Brett Clark). The difference in age was probably decided to allow this sex scene and more nudity than would be acceptable from a teenager.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coffman&quot;&gt;Coffman (2012), p. 23-26&lt;/ref&gt;

The second film adds a character with no counterpart in the original: Contessa Luciana ([[Sybil Danning]]). Contessa has a romantic night with Cody, before he moves into his next assignment. The relationship to the family is unspecified, but she turns out to have murdered Shane. She is beyond the reach of the law and suffers no ill consequences for her murder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coffman&quot;&gt;Coffman (2012), p. 23-26&lt;/ref&gt;
