It is a sequel to 2006's ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' and the second film in the [[Cars (franchise)|''Cars'' franchise]].

[[Paul Newman]], who voiced [[Doc Hudson]] in the previous film, died in September 2008, so his character was written out of the film; [[George Carlin]], who previously voiced [[List of Cars characters#Fillmore|Fillmore]], died during the same year, and his role was passed to [[Lloyd Sherr]]. The returning cast is joined by [[Michael Caine]], [[Emily Mortimer]], [[John Turturro]], [[Eddie Izzard]], and [[Thomas Kretschmann]], who voice the new characters introduced in this film.

The film follows race car [[Lightning McQueen]] (Wilson) and tow truck [[Mater (Cars)|Mater]] (Cable Guy), who head to Japan and Europe to compete in the World [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]], while Mater accidentally becomes sidetracked with international espionage, and then attempts to uncover a conspiracy led by a mysterious criminal mastermind and his gang, which threatens the lives of all competitors in the World Grand Prix, with the help of [[British people|British]] spies Finn McMissile (Caine) and Holley Shiftwell (Mortimer).

''Cars 2'' premiered in Hollywood on June 18, 2011, and was released in the United States on June 24, 2011. The film was presented in [[Disney Digital 3D]] and [[IMAX 3D]], as well as traditional two-dimensional and [[IMAX]] formats.&lt;ref name=SlashFilm&gt;{{cite news|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|title=Cars 2 Trailer|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/cars-2-trailer/|access-date=May 18, 2011|newspaper=SlashFilm|date=March 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the [[69th Golden Globe Awards]], but lost to ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (film)|The Adventures of Tintin]]''.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
British spy [[List of Cars characters#Finn McMissile|Finn McMissile]] infiltrates an oil rig owned by a group of [[Lemon (automobile)|lemon cars]] to rescue fellow spy Leland Turbo, who has blown his own cover. He witnesses the lemons, seemingly led by German weapons designer and scientist [[List of Cars characters#Professor Zündapp|Professor Zündapp]], load an [[electromagnetic pulse]] generator, disguised as a [[television camera|TV camera]] onto a shipping crate. After discovering Leland's death, a burst of flames reveals his presence to the criminals, and he escapes by faking his death.

Five years after the events of the  [[Cars (film)|first film]], after winning his fourth Piston Cup, [[Lightning McQueen]] returns to [[Radiator Springs]] to spend his off season with his friends. However, Italian [[formula racing|formula]] race car, [[Francesco Bernoulli]], challenges Lightning to race in the World Grand Prix, an international three-race event created by former oil tycoon Sir Miles Axlerod, who intends to promote his new environmentally friendly fuel, Allinol, and invites race cars from the world to compete. Lightning and his best friend Mater — along with [[Luigi (Cars)|Luigi]], [[Guido (Cars)|Guido]], [[Fillmore (Cars)|Fillmore]], and [[Sarge (Cars)|Sarge]] — depart for [[Tokyo]] for the first race of the World Grand Prix.

At a World Grand Prix promotional party event, Mater makes a scene after eating a bowl of [[wasabi]] and leaking on stage, embarrassing Lightning in front of everyone. While cleaning up, Mater interrupts a fight between American spy [[Rod &quot;Torque&quot; Redline]] (Finn's contact) and lemons [[List of Cars characters#Grem and Acer|Grem and Acer]]. Redline plants his tracking device on Mater, causing Finn and his associate Holley Shiftwell to mistake him for the spy. Meanwhile, Redline is captured and killed by Zündapp, who reveals that Allinol is set on fire when hit with the EMP from earlier. He informs his superior, an unknown mastermind, that Redline passed on his information. Holley finds and recruits Mater to stop Zündapp's plot.

At the first race, three racers are ignited by the camera, making their engines explode. Lightning places second in the race after Bernoulli, due to miscommunication with Mater, who was evading Zündapp's henchmen with help from Holley and Finn. Lightning angrily snaps at Mater, who then goes to the airport to return to Radiator Springs, but is abducted by Finn as the lemons close onto both, and they flee in Finn's jet, Siddeley. After traveling to [[Paris]], to collect more information from Finn's old friend Tomber, they travel to Porto Corsa, [[Italy]], where the second race is being held. During the race, Mater infiltrates the criminals' meeting, just as a few racers are flamed out by the camera, causing a multi-car pile-up, while Lightning wins. Due to increased fears over Allinol's safety, Axlerod lifts the requirement to use it for the final race in [[London]]. However, when Lightning decides to continue using it, the criminals plan to kill him in the race. Frightened by the realization that his best friend is in danger, Mater accidentally blows his cover, causing him, Finn, and Holley to be captured and tied up inside [[Big Ben]]tley, where he admits to them that he is not the spy they think he is.

When the race starts, Lightning takes the lead before passing Big Ben. However, the camera was inexplicably defective on him. The criminals tell Mater they planted a [[time bomb]] in Lightning's pits as a backup plan, spurring him to break free and escape. Finn and Holley escape soon after but realize that the bomb was fitted on Mater's air filter when they were passed out as the criminals predicted that Mater will easily escape to help Lightning. Mater had already arrived at the pits when they tell him this, so he flees down the track while Lightning chases after him to apologize for his outburst in Tokyo. Finn apprehends Zündapp when he attempts to escape. The other lemons arrive and outnumber Finn, Holley, Mater, and Lightning, but they are soon rescued by the arrival of the other Radiator Springs residents. Mater and Lightning go to [[Buckingham Palace]], where Mater exposes Axlerod as the mastermind behind the plot, proven after forcing him to disable the bomb. It is revealed that the World Grand Prix was a cover-up by Axelrod to turn the world against Allinol and other alternative fuels, and he was also the one who was leaking oil in Tokyo, blaming Mater for it. After Axlerod is arrested by the authorities, Mater receives an honorary knighthood from the Queen and Lightning and Mater reconcile.

Back in Radiator Springs, Mater tells everyone there about his story, just when Finn and Holley stop over. Fillmore then reveals that Sarge swapped the Allinol with Fillmore's organic fuel, which explains the camera's ineffectiveness on him. A &quot;Radiator Springs Grand Prix&quot; is held featuring all the World Grand Prix contenders. Mater declines an invitation from Finn and Holley to go on another mission, choosing to stay in Radiator Springs. Though his weapons get confiscated, he gets to keep the rockets and catches up to Lightning with speeding off with Mater behind him, just as Siddeley speeds into the distance.

==Voice cast==
{{Main|List of Cars characters}}
Much of the cast from the original ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' remained intact for the sequel, but three voice actors of the original film have died since its release. [[Joe Ranft]] (who voiced [[Red (Cars)|Red]]) died in an automobile accident on August 16, 2005, ten months before ''Cars'' (which was dedicated in memorial to him) was released, and therefore Red played no vocal role in the film. [[George Carlin]] (who voiced [[Fillmore (Cars)|Fillmore]]) died of heart failure on June 22, 2008 and was voiced by [[Lloyd Sherr]] (who also voices [[List of Cars characters#Tony Trihull|Tony Trihull]]). [[Paul Newman]] (who voiced [[Doc Hudson]]) died of cancer on September 26, 2008. After Newman's death, Lasseter said they would &quot;see how the story goes with Doc Hudson.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1599550/will-paul-newmans-character-return-cars-2.jhtml |title=Will Paul Newman's Character Return For 'Cars 2'? |access-date=January 17, 2011 |author=Adler, Shawn |date=November 17, 2010 |work=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doc was eventually dropped,&lt;ref name=&quot;LA times&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-sneaks-june-cars-20110116,0,427784.story |title=2011 Movie Preview: 'Cars 2' |access-date=March 4, 2011 |author=Keegan, Rebecca |date=January 16, 2011 |work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and implied to have died a few years before the events of ''Cars 2''.

The website's critical consensus reads, &quot;''Cars 2'' is as visually appealing as any other Pixar production, but all that dazzle can't disguise the rusty storytelling under the hood.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rottom&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cars_2/ |title= Cars 2 (2011) | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=April 5, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the lowest-rated Pixar film on the site to date and the only one to earn a &quot;rotten&quot; certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Corliss|first1=Richard|title=Cars 2 at the Box Office: Pixcar or Ishcar?|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2079906,00.html|access-date=November 28, 2016|magazine=Time|date=June 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McFarland |first1=K.M. |title=Pixar's Best Director Is Also Its Most Underrated |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/06/pixar-directors-by-the-numbers/ |publisher=Wired |access-date=November 28, 2016 |date=June 23, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223020057/https://www.wired.com/2015/06/pixar-directors-by-the-numbers/ |archive-date=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another review aggregator, [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[weighted mean|weighted average]] score to reviews from mainstream critics, gave the film an average score of 57 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/cars-2 | title=Cars 2 Reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |access-date=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|url=https://deadline.com/2017/06/cars-3-all-eyez-on-me-tupac-shakur-rough-night-scarlett-johansson-mandy-moore-47-meters-below-1202114764/|title='Cars 3' $53M+ Is 3rd Best Debut For Pixar Series; 'Wonder Woman' Still Wows With $40M+; 'All Eyez On Me' Solid|date=June 18, 2017|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=April 30, 2022 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220422031645/https://deadline.com/2017/06/cars-3-all-eyez-on-me-tupac-shakur-rough-night-scarlett-johansson-mandy-moore-47-meters-below-1202114764/ |archive-date=April 22, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;The original ''Cars'' was not greeted with exceptional warmth,&quot; said ''[[The New York Times]]'', &quot;but the sequel generated Pixar's first truly negative response.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes2&quot; /&gt; 
Critics generally criticized the focus on Mater and felt the film lacked warmth and charm, while also feeling the film was made as an exercise in target marketing and was too violent to deserve a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|G rating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rorie|first1=Matt|title=Was Cars 2 Too Violent For A G-Rating?|url=http://www.screened.com/news/was-cars-2-too-violent-for-a-g-rating/2473/|publisher=Screened|access-date=September 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629141858/http://www.screened.com/news/was-cars-2-too-violent-for-a-g-rating/2473/|archive-date=June 29, 2011|date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.msn.com/movies/article.aspx?news=656090|title='Cars 2': G-rating Grates Many Parents|access-date=September 18, 2014}}{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blankenship|first=Mark|title=Summer bummer: 5 most disappointing movies|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/44260890/ns/today-entertainment/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005003851/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/44260890/ns/today-entertainment/|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 5, 2012|access-date=July 4, 2012|newspaper=MSNBC|date=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starseeker.com/movie-review/cars-2-movie-review/|title=Cars 2 Movie Review|author=Dudley Dawson|date=June 28, 2011|access-date=January 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the film for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Joe Morgenstern wrote, “This frenzied sequel seldom gets beyond mediocrity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wallstjournal&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/movies/john-lasseter-of-pixar-defends-cars-2.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=2 | title= Oy Story: ''Cars 2'' Is a Dollar-Driven Edsel | author=Morgenstern, Joe |work=The Wall Street Journal| access-date=August 18, 2012 | date=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' critic [[Owen Gleiberman]] said, &quot;''Cars 2'' is a movie so stuffed with &quot;fun&quot; that it went right off the rails.

But Pixar proved the yaysayers wrong when it made its first bad movie, ''Cars''. Now it has worsted itself with the even more awful ''Cars 2''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/puts_the_drag_in_racing_BDuJ5yvpNNX9zStXwhhoZK| title= Puts the Drag in Racing| author=Smith, Kyle|work=New York Post| access-date=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the movie 3½ stars out of four, and said that &quot;the sequel is a tire-burning burst of action and fun with a beating heart under its hood.&quot; He also praised its &quot;fluid script&quot; and called it a &quot;winner&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Travers |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/cars-2-20110623 |title=Cars 2 &amp;#124; Movie Reviews |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=June 23, 2011 |access-date=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] was the most effusive of the more positive reviews, praising Lasseter's channeling of childhood playtime for the film's spirit and writing, “At a time when some ‘grown-up’ action films are relentlessly shallow and stupid, here is a movie with such complexity that even the cars sometimes have to pause and explain it to themselves.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110622/REVIEWS/110629995/1023|title=Cars 2 Movie Review|author=Ebert, Roger|work=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]|date=June 22, 2011|access-date=July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' commented, “The rare sequel that not only improves on but retroactively justifies its predecessor.”&lt;ref name=Variety&gt;{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Justin|title=Cars 2 Review|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117945476?refcatid=31|access-date=May 20, 2011|publisher=Variety|date=June 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ticket buyers also gave the film an A− in exit polls, on par with other Pixar titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes2&quot; /&gt;

A central current of the negative reviews was the theory that ''Cars 2'' was forced out of Pixar by its corporate parent, [[the Walt Disney Company]], out of greed [[Toyetic|to drive merchandising sales]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wallstjournal&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/02/business/02stewart.html?pagewanted=all| title= A Collision of Creativity and Cash | author=James B. Stewart |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 1, 2011| access-date=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasseter vehemently denied these claims, which he attributed to &quot;people who don’t know the facts, rushing to judge.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes2&quot; /&gt; Some theorized that the vitriol was less about the film but more about Pixar's broadened focus to sequels. ''The New York Times'' reported that although one negatively reviewed film would not be enough to scratch the studio, &quot;the commentary did dent morale at the studio, which until then had enjoyed an unbroken and perhaps unprecedented run of critical acclaim.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/movies/john-lasseter-of-pixar-defends-cars-2.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=2 | title= John Lasseter of Pixar Defends Cars 2 | author=Barnes, Brooks |work=The New York Times| access-date=December 2, 2011 | date=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
