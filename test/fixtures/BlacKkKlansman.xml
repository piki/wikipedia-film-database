Much of the cast joined the following month, and filming began in [[New York (state)|New York State]].

''BlacKkKlansman'' premiered on May 14, 2018, at the [[2018 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]], where it won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]]. It was theatrically released in the United States on August 10, 2018, a day before the first anniversary of the [[Unite the Right rally]]. The film received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised the performances (particularly of Washington and Driver) and timely themes, as well as noting it as a return to form for Lee. It received six nominations at the [[91st Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Lee's first directing nomination), and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Driver, and won for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], making it Lee's first competitive Academy Award. The [[American Film Institute]] also selected it as one of the [[American Film Institute Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|top 10 films of the 2018]], and at the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]] it earned four nominations, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture&amp;nbsp;– Drama|Best Motion Picture – Drama]].

==Plot==
The film starts with footage from ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939) of wounded [[Confederate States Army|Confederate soldiers]] lying in the streets of [[Atlanta, Georgia]] which transitions to a black-and-white [[Public service announcement|PSA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/08/19/how-spike-lee-blackkklansman-expertly-uses-gone-wind-shaft-cameos/1020950002/ |title=How Spike Lee's 'BlacKkKlansman' expertly uses 'Gone With the Wind,' 'Shaft' cameos |first=Bill |last=Keveney |date=24 August 2018 |access-date=27 July 2019 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a man (named as Dr. Kennebrew Beauregard) comically fumbles a hate-filled screed decrying minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/movies/spike-lee-blackkklansman.html |title=Spike Lee Takes on the Klan |first=Salamishah |last=Tillet |author-link=Salamishah Tillet |date=2 August 2018 |access-date=27 July 2019 |newspaper=[[NY Times]] |page=1 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film then jumps to the central plot.

In 1972, [[Ron Stallworth]] is hired as the first [[African Americans|black]] officer in the [[Colorado Springs Police Department]]. Assigned to work in the records room, he faces racial discrimination from his coworkers. After he requests a transfer to undercover work, he is assigned to infiltrate a local rally where national civil rights leader [[Stokely Carmichael|Kwame Ture (a.k.a. Stokely Carmichael)]] gives a speech. At the rally, Stallworth meets Patrice Dumas, president of the Black Student Union at [[Colorado College]]. While she takes Ture to his hotel, Patrice is stopped by patrolman Andy Landers, a racist officer in Stallworth's precinct, who threatens Ture and gropes Patrice.

After the rally, Stallworth is reassigned to the intelligence division. After reading about a local division of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in the newspaper, he calls posing as [[White Americans|white]] and speaks with Walter Breachway, the president of the [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] chapter. Stallworth recruits his [[Jewish Americans|Jewish]] coworker, Flip Zimmerman, to act as him to meet the Klan members. Zimmerman meets Walter, the slightly more reckless Felix Kendrickson (and later his wife Connie), and Ivanhoe, who cryptically refers to an upcoming attack.

Calling Klan headquarters in [[Louisiana]] to expedite his membership, Stallworth begins regular phone conversations with [[Grand Wizard]] [[David Duke]]. Kendrickson suspects Zimmerman of being Jewish and tries to make him take a [[polygraph]] test at gunpoint, but Stallworth breaks the Kendricksons' kitchen window to distract them. Stallworth begins dating Patrice, but does not tell her that he is a police officer. After passing information to the [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|Army CID]] about active duty members, he learns from an [[FBI]] agent that two members are personnel stationed at [[NORAD]].

Duke visits Colorado Springs for Stallworth's induction into the Klan. Over the real Stallworth's protests, he is assigned to a protection detail for Duke. Once Zimmerman is initiated, masquerading as Stallworth, Connie leaves the ceremony to place a bomb at a local civil rights rally. Stallworth realizes her intentions and alerts local police officers. When Connie notices a heavy police presence at the rally, she puts Felix's backup plan into action and plants the bomb at Patrice's house, leaving it under her car when it will not fit into the mailbox. Stallworth tackles her as she tries to flee, but uniformed officers detain and beat him despite his protests that he is working undercover.
[[File:Birth of a Nation (1915).webm|thumb|right|200px|Scenes from 'Birth of a Nation (1915)' are used in the film]]

The bombmaker, Walker, recognizes Zimmerman from a prior arrest, and informs Felix. He, Felix and Ivanhoe arrive and trigger the bomb while Ron is being detained. Not realizing where Connie hid it, they detonate it while next to Patrice's car, with the force of the blast overturning their car, killing everyone in the vehicle. Zimmerman arrives and frees Stallworth, and Connie is arrested. While celebrating the closed case that night with Patrice, Landers arrives and harasses the two, drunkenly (and remorselessly) admitting to his assault on Patrice; Stallworth then reveals he is wearing a [[covert listening device|wire]], before the police chief arrives and arrests Landers for [[police brutality]].

Police Chief Bridges congratulates the team for their success, but orders them to end their investigation and destroy the records. Stallworth receives a call from Duke, and he reveals to Duke that he is black before hanging up. While Patrice and Stallworth discuss their future, they are interrupted by a knock on the door. Through the window in the hallway, they see a [[cross burning|flaming cross]] on a hillside surrounded by Klan members.

==Historical inaccuracy==
Although based on a true story, the film dramatizes the events of the book, and the time period has been shifted. Notably:

* The true identity of Stallworth's partner remains secret. He never went public with his story due to his face-to-face interaction with the Klan. The character portrayed by [[Adam Driver]] was developed by Spike Lee as a plot device.
* The actual events occurred in 1979; the film is set in 1972.
* The first third of the film is relatively accurate, but the bomb plot in the film was inspired by an unrelated actual [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|KKK bombing]].
* Some members in the actual KKK chapter had high-ranking military positions. As a result of the investigation, four members of the US military were reassigned. Stallworth later joked they were &quot;sent to the North Pole&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Editorial: why the movie 'Blackkklansman' matters |url=https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-why-the-movie-blackkklansman-matters/article_d3389e35-06ee-5264-b5d7-e7269b2a640d.html |newspaper=[[The Roanoke Times]] |date=August 17, 2018 |accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The character Patrice is fictional, Stallworth was dating his future wife at the time of the investigation.

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 96% based on 417 reviews, with an average rating of 8.29/10. The website's critical consensus reads, &quot;''BlacKkKlansman'' uses history to offer bitingly trenchant commentary on current events—and brings out some of Spike Lee's hardest-hitting work in decades along the way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blackkklansman/|title=BlacKkKlansman (2018)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=February 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 83 out of 100, based on 56 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/blackkklansman|title=BlacKkKlansman Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of &quot;A–&quot; on an A+ to F scale, while [[PostTrak]] reported filmgoers gave it an 85% positive score and a 67% &quot;definite recommend&quot;.&lt;ref name=opening/&gt;

[[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the film three out of five stars, writing: &quot;It's an entertaining spectacle but the brilliant tonal balance in something like Jordan Peele's satire ''Get Out'' leaves this looking a little exposed. Yet it responds fiercely, contemptuously to the crassness at the heart of the Trump regime and gleefully pays it back in its own coin&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/14/blackkklansman-review-spike-lee-adam-driver-cannes-2018|title=BlacKkKlansman review – Spike Lee's clanging rebuke to the New Trump Order|website=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]] |last=Bradshaw |first=Peter |date=May 14, 2018 |accessdate=May 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''[[IndieWire]]'', David Ehrlich gave the film a grade of &quot;B+&quot; and wrote that it is &quot;far more frightening than it is funny&quot;, and &quot;packages such weighty and ultra-relevant subjects into the form of a wildly uneven but consistently entertaining night at the movies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/05/blackkklansman-review-spike-lee-cannes-2018-1201964558/ |title='BlacKkKlansman' Review: Spike Lee Detonates a Funny and Righteously Furious 'Fuck You' to Trump – Cannes 2018|website=[[IndieWire]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]] |last=Ehrlich |first=David |date=May 14, 2018 |accessdate=May 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. O. Scott]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', saw the film as both political and provocative in opening up discussion on timely subject matter following Charlottesville. He stated, &quot;Committed anti-racists can sit quietly or laugh politely when hateful things are said. Epithets uttered in irony can be repeated in earnest. The most shocking thing about Flip's (Adam Driver's undercover detective role) imposture is how easy it seems, how natural he looks and sounds. This unnerving authenticity is partly testament to Mr. Driver's ability to tuck one performance inside another, but it also testifies to a stark and discomforting truth. Maybe not everyone who is white is a racist, but racism is what makes us white. Don't sleep on this movie&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=A. O. |last=Scott |title=America's Heart of Darkness |website=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=August 9, 2018 |accessdate=August 21, 2018 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/09/movies/blackkklansman-review-spike-lee.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review for ''Vulture'', David Edelstein found the film to be a potent antidote for previous films which Lee sees as unduly supportive of the racist viewpoint in the past, such as Griffith's ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]''. He stated: &quot;Lee himself has a propagandist streak, and he knows nothing ever sold the message of white emasculation and the existential necessity of keeping blacks down as well as Griffith's 1915 film. It revived the Klan and—insult to injury—is still reckoned a landmark of narrative [[filmmaking]]. If there were no other reason to make ''BlackkKlansman'', this one would be good enough&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David |last=Edelstein |date=August 6, 2018 |accessdate=August 21, 2018 |title=Spike Lee's BlacKkKlansman Is an Entertaining and Effective Piece of Melodrama |url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/08/spike-lee-blackkklansman-movie-review.html |publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York Media]] |website=Vulture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmmaker [[Boots Riley]], whose feature film debut ''[[Sorry to Bother You (film)|Sorry to Bother You]]'' also premiered in 2018, took to [[Twitter]] on August 17 to criticize the film for its political perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=BootsRiley |first=Boots |last=Riley |number=1030575674447212544 |date=August 17, 2018 |title= Ok.

In particular, Riley alleged that the film glossed over Stallworth's time spent working for [[COINTELPRO]] to &quot;sabotage a Black radical organization&quot; and objected to the film's choices to portray Stallworth's partner as Jewish and to fictionalize a bombing &quot;to make the police seem like heroes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kaplan |first=Ilana |date=August 19, 2018 |title=Boots Riley pens essay on problems with 'BlacKkKlansman' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/boots-riley-pens-essay-on-problems-with-blackkklansman-713144/ |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dessem |first=Matthew |date=August 18, 2018 |title=''Sorry to Bother You'' Director Boots Riley Has a Blistering Critique of Spike Lee's ''BlacKkKlansman'' |url=https://slate.com/culture/2018/08/boots-riley-vs-spike-lee-the-sorry-to-bother-you-director-tweeted-a-blistering-critique-of-blackkklansman.html |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |publisher=[[The Slate Group]] |access-date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shoard |first=Catherine |date=August 20, 2018 |title=Boots Riley attacks Spike Lee over 'made up' BlacKkKlansman|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/20/boots-riley-spike-lee-blackkklansman |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]] |access-date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee responded in an interview with ''[[The Times]]'' on August 24, stating that while his films &quot;have been very critical of the police&amp;nbsp;...
